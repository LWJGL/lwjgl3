        Please describe the issue with as much detail as possible and clear steps to reproduce. If a stacktrace or crash log is available, please attach it below. It would be extremely helpful if you could attach a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

        Note that it's quite common for bugs to be caused by the native library which LWJGL provides bindings for. So please make sure that your issue is not already reported in the repository of the corresponding library.
