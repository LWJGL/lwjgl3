        Ask anything about developing LWJGL applications or the development of LWJGL itself!

        However, questions regarding native API usage (e.g. how do I do X in OpenGL?) are out of scope. Try the Forum/Slack/Discord links, you'll find plenty of people willing to help.

        Finally, try searching the existing issues first, your question may have been answered already.
