### 3.1.6

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- bgfx: Updated to API version 59 (up from 55)
- glfw: Updated to pre-release 3.3.0 version (up from 3.3.0 pre-release):
    * Support for lock key modifiers (`GLFW_LOCK_KEY_MODS` input mode, `GLFW_MOD_CAPS_LOCK`, `GLFW_MOD_NUM_LOCK`)
    * Support for string window hints (`glfwWindowHintString`, `GLFW_COCOA_FRAME_NAME`, `GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME`, `GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME`)
    * Support monitor & joystick user ponters (`glfwSetMonitorUserPointer`, `glfwGetMonitorUserPointer`, `glfwSetJoystickUserPointer`, `glfwGetJoystickUserPointer`)
    * Support for window content scale callbacks (`glfwSetWindowContentScaleCallback`)
    * Support for cursor hover tests (`GLFW_HOVERED`)
- Nuklear: Update to 3.00.1 (up from 2.00.4)
- OpenVR: Updated to 1.0.12 (up from 1.0.10)
- rpmalloc: Updated to 1.2.1 (up from 1.2.0)
- tinyfiledialogs: Updated to 3.2.7 (up from 3.2.4)
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.0.66 (up from 1.0.65)
- xxhash: Updated to 0.6.4 (up from 0.6.3)
- Zstd: Updated to 1.3.3 (up from 1.3.2)

#### Improvements

- Added [JSR-305](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305) nullability annotations to the core and all bindings.
    * Enables static analysis tools ([FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), IDEs) to detect accesses that could cause `NullPointerException`. Eliminating those improves the quality of LWJGL applications.
    * Enables better interopation with JVM-based languages that feature built-in null-safety. For example, see [Kotlin's JSR-305 support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#jsr-305-support).
- Added `Configuration` setting to disable function lookup checks.
- lmdb: Databases are now binary compatible across 32 & 64-bit architectures. (#364)
    * `MDB_VL32` is enabled on 32-bit builds.
- par_shapes: Patched to support 32-bit indices and extremely dense meshes.
- stb_truetype: Exposed members of internal structures for advanced glyph packing customization.
- Tootle: Now supports the Direct3D rasterizer for overdraw optimization.

#### Fixes

- Fixed broken javadoc links in all bindings. Also updated URLs to avoid redirects.
- bgfx: Restored default API thread encoder functions, that were erroneously removed in `3.1.4`.
- LibOVR: Fixed `ovr_TraceMessage` signature. 
- OpenAL: Fixed capability name of the `AL_SOFT_source_resampler` extension.
- Tootle: Fixed `pnClusterRemapOut` parameter validation.

#### Breaking Changes

- Several methods that previously accepted `null`/`NULL` and returned `null`, now require non-null input.
    * Applies to: struct & callback creation methods and `memByteBuffer`/`memUTF8`/`stack.UTF8`/etc.
    * Added corresponding methods with the `Safe` suffix that accept `null`/`NULL`, matching the old behavior.
    * With this change the common case (non-null input) requires no code changes and is warning/error-free. The uncommon case (null input) is recognizable (the suffix) and must be handled properly to eliminate warnings/errors. 
- Allocation methods that returned `null`/`NULL` on allocation failure, now throw `OutOfMemoryError` instead. This matches the behavior of `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect`.
    * Applies to: struct allocation methods and `memAlloc`/`memCalloc`/etc.
    * Does not apply to allocations via direct binding calls (e.g. `LibCStdlib.malloc`).
- Getters of struct members that should never be `NULL`, throw `NullPointerException` instead of returning `null` when the struct instance is not initialized.
    * Use `Struct::isNull` to test pointer members of untrusted struct instances.
- glfw: `glfwInitHintString` has been renamed to `glfwWindowHintString`.
- lmdb: Databases developed on 32-bit architectures must be recreated.
- par_shapes: Changed `par_shapes_mesh::triangles` from `uint16_t/ShortBuffer` to `uint32_t/IntBuffer`. 
- stb_rect_pack: `stbrp_rect::was_packed` is now mapped to Java `boolean`.
