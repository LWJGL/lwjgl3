#### Improvements

- Added [JSR-305](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305) nullability annotations to the core and all bindings.
    * Enables static analysis tools ([FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), IDEs) to detect accesses that could cause `NullPointerException`. Eliminating those improves the quality of LWJGL applications.
    * Enables better interopation with JVM-based languages that feature built-in null-safety. For example, see [Kotlin's JSR-305 support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#jsr-305-support).
- Added `Configuration` setting to disable function lookup checks.
- lmdb: Databases are now binary compatible across 32 & 64-bit architectures. (#364)
    * `MDB_VL32` is enabled on 32-bit builds.
- par_shapes: Patched to support 32-bit indices and extremely dense meshes.
- stb_truetype: Exposed members of internal structures for advanced glyph packing customization.
- Tootle: Now supports the Direct3D rasterizer for overdraw optimization.

#### Fixes

- Fixed broken javadoc links in all bindings. Also updated URLs to avoid redirects.
- bgfx: Restored default API thread encoder functions, that were erroneously removed in `3.1.4`.
- LibOVR: Fixed `ovr_TraceMessage` signature. 
- OpenAL: Fixed capability name of the `AL_SOFT_source_resampler` extension.
- Tootle: Fixed `pnClusterRemapOut` parameter validation.

#### Breaking Changes

- Several methods that previously accepted `null`/`NULL` and returned `null`, now require non-null input.
    * Applies to: struct & callback creation methods and `memByteBuffer`/`memUTF8`/`stack.UTF8`/etc.
    * Added corresponding methods with the `Safe` suffix that accept `null`/`NULL`, matching the old behavior.
    * With this change the common case (non-null input) requires no code changes and is warning/error-free. The uncommon case (null input) is recognizable (the suffix) and must be handled properly to eliminate warnings/errors. 
- Allocation methods that returned `null`/`NULL` on allocation failure, now throw `OutOfMemoryError` instead. This matches the behavior of `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect`.
    * Applies to: struct allocation methods and `memAlloc`/`memCalloc`/etc.
    * Does not apply to allocations via direct binding calls (e.g. `LibCStdlib.malloc`).
- Getters of struct members that should never be `NULL`, throw `NullPointerException` instead of returning `null` when the struct instance is not initialized.
    * Use `Struct::isNull` to test pointer members of untrusted struct instances.
- bgfx: Restored native mapping of `bgfx_init(_vendorId)` and `bgfx_update_texture_cube(_side)` parameters.
- bgfx: `uint16_t` bitfield constants are now mapped to `int`. 
- glfw: `glfwInitHintString` has been renamed to `glfwWindowHintString`.
- lmdb: Databases developed on 32-bit architectures must be recreated.
- par_shapes: Changed `par_shapes_mesh::triangles` from `uint16_t/ShortBuffer` to `uint32_t/IntBuffer`. 
- stb_rect_pack: `stbrp_rect::was_packed` is now mapped to Java `boolean`.
