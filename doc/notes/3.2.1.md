### 3.2.1

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- bgfx: Updated to API version 88 (up from 76)
- glfw: Updated to pre-release 3.3.0 version (up from 3.3.0 pre-release):
    * Added `GLFW_SCALE_TO_MONITOR`.
- tinyfiledialogs: Updated to 3.3.7 (up from 3.3.6)
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.1.86 (up from 1.0.82)
    * Includes MoltenVK 1.0.23 (up from 1.0.16)

#### Improvements

- perf(core): Refactored LWJGL internals to make call stacks shallower.
    * Makes it harder to cross Hotspot's default `MaxInlineLevel` threshold, which can disable important optimizations.
- perf(core): Added `memDuplicate` and refactored `memSlice` with implementations that use `Unsafe` to construct buffer instances, similar to `mem-X-Buffer`.
    * Compared to the default JDK implementations, these methods are faster and enable Scalar Replacement via EA on Hotspot.
    * The `memSlice` with offset method is also thread-safe now.
- perf(core): Implemented workarounds to make struct buffer iteration garbage free on Hotspot.
- perf(core): Re-tuned string codecs and `memCopy`/`memSet` for Java versions 8 to 11.
- bgfx: Builds of bgfx tools (`geometryc`, `shaderc`, `texturec`, `texturev`) are now available.
    * Use the [file browser](https://www.lwjgl.org/browse) in the LWJGL website to download the executables.
    * For example, the latest Windows x64 build of `shaderc` can be found under `nightly/windows/x64/bgfx-tools/`.
- vma: `VmaVulkanFunctions.set(VkInstance, VkDevice)` will now use Vulkan 1.1 functions instead of `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` functions, if available.

#### Fixes

- Core: Fixed text decoding from buffer with `.position() > 0`.
    * Affected all decoders on Java 9+, only UTF-16 on Java 8.
- Core: Fixed the bounds check in `memCopy`. (#414)
- OpenVR: The `pGamePoseArray` parameter of `VRCompositor_WaitGetPoses` is now nullable. (#418)
- vma: The native library is now initialized automatically.
- vma: Optional `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` addresses in `VmaVulkanFunctions` are now nullable.
- vma: Nullability of `VmaAllocationCreateInfo` & `VmaAllocationInfo` members.

#### Breaking Changes

```
(B): binary incompatible change
(S): source incompatible change
```

- Core: `sun.misc.Unsafe` is now required, there is no JNI fallback.
- vma: The `VmaVulkanFunctions.set` helper method now returns `VmaVulkanFunctions`. **(B)**
