#### Improvements

- macOS/Windows: Added support for ARM builds. (#601)
    * Maven classifier for macOS: `natives-macos-arm64`
    * Maven classifier for Windows: `natives-windows-arm64`
- Generator: Struct member javadoc moved to the corresponding getter method.
    * There are links to the getter method in the class javadoc (`Layout` section) and in the javadoc of the corresponding setter and `.Buffer` accessors. 
    * Makes it easier to navigate to the documentation of a particular member.
- Core: Replaced internal usages of dyncall with libffi.
    * This resolves a range of long-standing issues, mainly with upcalls (callbacks).
    * Single native callback handler used for all upcalls, regardless of signature. Arguments and return values handled Java-side (per callback type).
    * Improved upcall performance (before: JNI downcall per argument, after: simple memory accesses)
    * Support for structs returned by-value. (#283)
- Core: Implemented overflow protection in text encoding methods.
- Core: When LWJGL fails to resolve native libraries, it will now attempt to report native JAR files in the classpath with mismatching platform/architecture. (#587)
- docs: The javadoc of callback classes/interfaces now includes a link to the corresponding `invoke` method, for better IDE navigation.
- macOS: Shared libraries are now built with Xcode 11.3 (up from 10.0)
- GLFW: Added overrides for internally loaded shared libraries.
    * Useful when there's a mismatch with the library loaded by LWJGL.
    * `GLFWNativeEGL.setEGLPath` & `GLFWNativeEGL.setGLESPath`
    * `GLFWNativeGLX.setPath`
    * `GLFWNativeNSGL.setFramework`
    * `GLFWNativeWGL.setPath`
    * `GLFWVulkan.setPath`
- GL: Added support for OSMesa contexts. (#595)
- GL/GLES/AL: Added `createCapabilities` overloads that accept an `IntFunction<PointerBuffer>`. Enables explicit management of the off-heap memory used by the capabilities instances.
- GL/GLES/AL: When capabilities creation fails, the current thread/process capabilities state is no longer reset to null.
- OpenAL: Introduced `ALC::setCapabilities`. Rarely useful when opening multiple devices with different ALC capabilities. (#582)

#### Fixes

- Generator: Native libraries are now initialized before constants. (#630)
- Core: Fixed unsafe field reads in `MemoryUtil` setup code. (#632)
- EGL: Fixed nullability of `eglInitialize` arguments.
- GLFW: Fixed main thread check. Setting `GLFW_CHECK_THREAD0` to `false` is now required for offscreen interop. (#538)
- OpenCL: Added missing `errcode_ret` parameter to `clLinkProgram`. (#560)
- OpenGL: Restored `GL_TEXTURE` in the core profile. (#573)
- OpenGL: Added buffer object offset overloads to `GetQueryObject*` functions.
- stb: Removed redundant `stb_image_resize` overloads. (#605)
- Vulkan: Fixed GLFW configuration for MoltenVK. (#502)
- Vulkan: Fixed `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` to work with `null` instance arguments.
- Vulkan: Fixed unsigned arithmetic in `VK_VERSION_MAJOR` and `VK_VERSION_MINOR` macros.
    
#### Breaking Changes

- Removed deprecated methods that were marked for removal in LWJGL 3.3. (S)
- Core: Users of the dyncall bindings must migrate to libffi. (S)
- Shaderc: The shaderc_spvc library has been removed since Shaderc 2020.4. Users may migrate to the new SPIRV-Cross bindings. (S)
- Vulkan: All header boilerplate constants have been moved to `VK10`. (S)
