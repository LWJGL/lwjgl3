_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [LZ4](http://lz4.github.io/lz4/) bindings.
- Added [NanoSVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg) to the existing `NanoVG` bindings.
- Added [Remotery](https://github.com/Celtoys/Remotery) bindings.
- Added [Zstandard](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/) bindings.
- bgfx: Updated to API version 53 (up from 48)
- glfw: Updated to pre-release 3.3.0 version (up from 3.3.0 pre-release):
    * Support for transparent window framebuffers (`GLFW_TRANSPARENT` window hint)
    * Support for content scale queries (`glfwGetMonitorContentScale` and `glfwGetWindowContentScale`)
- LibOVR: Updated to 1.19.0 (up from 1.18.0)
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.0.65 (up from 1.0.61)

#### Improvements

- Replaced `Automatic-Module-Name` with explicit JPMS modules.
    * Enables applications using LWJGL to be bundled in custom run-time images with the `jlink` tool.

#### Fixes

- EGL: Fixed nullability of `eglMakeCurrent` arguments.
- OpenVR: Fixed mapping of Vulkan forward declarations.
- Fixed native library resource discovery when running LWJGL as JPMS modules.
- Fixed invalid size calculation in `<StructType>.malloc(capacity)` methods.
- Fixed `MemoryStack` debugging when a try-with-resources block does not inline the call to `AutoCloseable::close`.
    * Supports Java 9 try-with-resources, which generates a synthetic `$closeResource` method.
    * Supports Kotlin's `T.use`, which uses the `kotlin.AutoCloseable::closeFinally` extension function.
