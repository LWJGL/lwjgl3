### 3.2.3

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [Shaderc](https://github.com/google/shaderc) bindings. (#77)
- glfw: Updated to 3.4.0 pre-release (up from 3.3.0):
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.1.109 (up from 1.0.107)
    * Includes MoltenVK 1.0.35

#### Improvements

- Added support for Linux ARM builds.
    * 32-bit: ARMv7/armhf
    * 64-bit: ARMv8/AArch64
- Shared libraries in native JAR files have been moved from the root to a per-architecture subfolder.
    * The `32` suffix has been dropped from `Windows x86` shared libraries.
    * The currently supported architectures are: `x64`, `x86`, `arm64`, `arm32`.
    * This way multiple native JAR files can be combined for custom deployment.
    * Custom (or the old) behavior may be enabled with newly exposed `Configuration` options.
- Core: Added `enum Platform.Architecture` and `Platform.getArchitecture()` API.
- Core: Added relative & absolute `apply(Consumer<T>)` methods to `StructBuffer<T>`. 
- Core: Added `Consumer<T>` setters to structs with nested arrays of structs.

#### Fixes

- EGL/GLES: Fixed bootstrapping code.
    * Regression caused by `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` refactoring in `3.2.2`.

#### Breaking Changes

```
(B): binary incompatible change
(S): source incompatible change
```

- Core: Removed `Consumer<T>` overloads from read-only structs with nested struct members. **(S)**
- Vulkan: The `descriptorCount` member of `VkWriteDescriptorSet` must now be set explicitly. **(S)**
    * The semantics of `descriptorCount` may change via extensions, which invalidates auto-sizing.
