        * Query the SDL compatible GUID of a joystick (`glfwGetJoystickGUID`)
    * Linux: Moved to [evdev](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/doc/latest/) for joystick input

#### Improvements

- Generator: Added `@NativeType` annotations to generated bindings. Documents the native type of:
    * Callback and struct classes.
    * Struct members.
    * Function parameters and return values.

#### Fixes

- bgfx: Fixed signature of `bgfx_create_frame_buffer_from_attachment`.
- OpenGL: Fixed signature of `glPixelStoref`.
- OpenGL: `ARB_direct_state_access` interactions are now respected when checking if the extension is available.
- stb_truetype: Fixed signature of `stbtt_PackFontRangesGatherRects` and `stbtt_PackFontRangesRenderIntoRects`.

#### Breaking Changes

- glfw: Signature of `glfwGetError` has changed.
- OpenCL: Removed two confusing `clCompileProgram` overloads.
