    * 64-bit: ARMv8/AArch64 architecture. Maven classifier: `linux-arm64`
- Windows: There is now a separate native JAR file per architecture.
    * The default contains x64 shared libraries only. Maven classifier: `windows`
    * `lwjgl-natives-windows-x86.jar` contains x86 shared libraries only. Maven classifier: `windows-x86`
    * The `32` suffix has been dropped from x86 shared library names.
- Windows: Shared libraries are now built with Visual Studio 2019 (up from 2017)

    * The [build customizer](https://www.lwjgl.org/customize) may be used to migrate Maven/Gradle scripts. 
- Refactored the layout of native JAR files.
    * Shared libraries have been moved from the root to a `<platform>/<arch>/<module>/` subfolder.
        * `<platform>`: one of `linux`, `macos`, `windows`.
        * `<arch>`: one of `x64`, `x86`, `arm64`, `arm32`.
        * `<module>`: the corresponding Java module name as a package hierarchy.
        * Example: `glfw.so` in `lwjgl-glfw-natives-linux.jar` is under the `linux/x64/org/lwjgl/glfw` folder.
    * The new layout allows multiple native JAR files to be combined for custom deployment.
    * Custom (or the old) layout may be used with newly exposed `Configuration` options.
- Core: Added `enum Platform.Architecture` and `Platform.getArchitecture()` API.
- Core: Added relative & absolute `apply(Consumer<T>)` methods to `StructBuffer<T>`. 
- Core: Added `Consumer<T>` setters to structs with nested arrays of structs.
- Core: Added `memByteBuffer` overloads that return `ByteBuffer` views of other buffer types.
- Core: Added `CLongBuffer`, a class similar to `PointerBuffer` but for C `long` values.

#### Fixes

- Core: Removed support for Critical JNI Natives. (#490)
    * Will be restored in LWJGL 3.3 (disabled by default, enabled with a `Configuration` option). 
- Core: Fixed buffer attachment offset detection on JDK 12+. (#491)
- Core: Fixed `ByteBuffer` attachments in `memSlice` & `memDuplicate`.
- Generator: Fixed invalid generation of functions with struct parameters passed by value. (#496)
    * Affected bindings: OpenVR and LLVM/Clang.
- Generator: Improved javadoc for array and nested struct members.

    * Regression caused by `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` refactoring in `3.2.2`.
- LLVM: Fixed default library names.
- lmdb: Reverted to the official release. (#482)
    * Windows: Performance issues are eliminated, but sparse database mappings & incremental file growth are not supported anymore.
- OpenGL: Fixed signatures of `glGetnUniformiv` and `glGetnUniformuiv`.

#### Breaking Changes

```
(B): binary incompatible change
(S): source incompatible change
```

- Core: The `Library.loadSystem` & `Library.loadNative` methods now require a module name parameter. **(S)**
- Core: Removed `Consumer<T>` overloads from read-only structs with nested struct members. **(S)**
- Core: `MemoryUtil.memFree(PointerBuffer)` changed to `memFree(CustomBuffer)`. **(B)**
- LZ4: The `autoFlush` and `favorDecSpeed` members of `LZ4F_preferences_t` are now mapped to Java `boolean`. **(S)**
- Vulkan: The `descriptorCount` member of `VkWriteDescriptorSet` must now be set explicitly. **(S)**
    * The semantics of `descriptorCount` may change via extensions, which invalidates auto-sizing.
    
#### Known Issues

- Vulkan: GLFW configuration for MoltenVK is broken in LWJGL 3.2.3. (#502)
    * This issue is fixed in LWJGL 3.3.0.

#### Breaking Changes

- Core: Function address parameters in `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` & `org.lwjgl.system.jawt.JAWTFunctions` methods are now last, after normal parameters. **(S)**
    * Enables tail-calls without argument shuffling, when Critical JNI Natives are used.
- glfw: removed `CharSequence` overload of `glfwUpdateGamepadMappings`. **(S)** (#462)

#### Known Issues

- Core: LWJGL 3.2.2 is incompatible with Java 12 or higher. (#491)
    * This issue is fixed in LWJGL 3.2.3.
- Core: Using LWJGL 3.2.2 with a garbage collector that does not support object pinning, may lead to excessive GC-related blocking. (#490)
    * Workaround: pass `-XX:-CriticalJNINatives` to the JVM.
    * This issue is fixed in LWJGL 3.2.3.

#### Improvements

- perf(core): Refactored LWJGL internals to make call stacks shallower.
    * Makes it harder to cross Hotspot's default `MaxInlineLevel` threshold, which can disable important optimizations.
- perf(core): Added `memDuplicate` and refactored `memSlice` with implementations that use `Unsafe` to construct buffer instances, similar to `mem-X-Buffer`.
    * Compared to the default JDK implementations, these methods are faster and enable Scalar Replacement via EA on Hotspot.
    * The `memSlice` with offset method is also thread-safe now.
- perf(core): Implemented workarounds to make struct buffer iteration garbage free on Hotspot.

- Generator: The template DSL has been simplified considerably.
- Generator: Added the `LWJGL Template Extraction Tool`. It uses the new Clang bindings to parse native headers and extract LWJGL template declarations.
    * Extracts both declarations and associated documentation.
    * Written in Kotlin. The source can be found in the `extract` module.

#### Fixes

### 3.2.0

_Released 2018 Jul 30_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator) bindings.
- bgfx: Updated to API version 76 (up from 60)
    * `bgfx_init` now accepts a parameter structure instead of arguments.
- glfw: Updated to pre-release 3.3.0 version (up from 3.3.0 pre-release):

    * Read the `org.lwjgl.opengl` package javadoc for more information on this feature.
- OpenVR: Updated to 1.0.16 (up from 1.0.12)
- rpmalloc: Updated to 1.3.1 (up from 1.2.2)
- stb
    * Updated `stb_image` to 2.19 (up from 2.18)
    * Updated `stb_image_write` to 1.09 (up from 1.08)
    * Updated `stb_truetype` to 1.19 (up from 1.18)

- Yoga: Updated to 1.9.0 (up from 1.7.1)
- Zstd: Updated to 1.3.5 (up from 1.3.4)

#### Improvements

- Versioned classes in bindings now form inheritance hierarchies.
    * Applicable to the following versioned classes: `AL`, `ALC`, `CL`, `EGL`, `GL`, `GLES`, `GLX`, `VK`
    * For example, the `GL30` class now extends the `GL21` class, `GL21` extends `GL20` and so on.
    * With this change, importing a versioned class allows all symbols up to that version to be resolved. Earlier versions do not need to be imported separately.
- perf(core): `memGetAddress`/`memPutAddress` are now an order of magnitude faster on 32-bit JVMs.
- perf(core): Optimized pointer arithmetic by helping the JVM identify unsigned integers.
- perf(core): The new `java.util.Objects` index check intrinsics are used on Java 9.
- perf(core): `MemoryUtil` string decoding methods are now faster on both Java 8 and 9+.
    * The Java 9 implementations are tuned for compact strings ([JEP 254](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/254)).
- perf(generator):  Function pointers in capabilities classes are not sorted by name anymore.
    * This makes it more likely that for functions that are commonly used together, their respective pointers
    will be closer in memory, avoiding unnecessary cache misses.
- Generator: `org.lwjgl.system.JNI` now includes signatures for known callback functions.
    * Can be used for callback function delegation.
- Generator: Added support for custom methods in struct classes.
- Generator: Added fluent setters for nested structs.
- Generator: Made StructBuffer subclass generation optional.
- Loader: Now prints the path of shared libraries loaded from system paths in debug mode, when possible.
- docs(core): Improved `PointerBuffer` javadoc.
- docs: The LWJGL javadoc is now generated with JDK 10.
- Core: `MemoryUtil` methods now replace requests for zero-size allocations with non-zero-size allocations.
    * A zero-size allocation now always returns a non-`NULL` pointer or throws an `OOME`. This is consistent with `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect` and avoids the undefined behavior of native allocators.
    * The returned buffer has a capacity of zero, regardless of the actual allocation size.
- Core `MemoryUtil.memRealloc` is not `@Nullable` anymore, will either succeed or throw an `OOME`, like `memAlloc/memCalloc`.
- Core: It is now possible to create a `MemoryStack` backed by externally managed memory.
- Core: The debug allocator now also tracks internal allocations of shared libraries that have been configured to use the LWJGL memory allocator.
    * This enables monitoring/debugging allocations inside shared libraries. Internal resources that are never released are now reported on shutdown.
    * Enabled by default when `Configuration.DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR` is enabled.
    * May be disabled with `Configuration.DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR_INTERNAL.set(false)`. 
- LMDB: The LWJGL memory allocator is now used for internal allocations.
- NanoVG/NanoSVG: The LWJGL memory allocator is now used for internal allocations.
- OpenGL/GLES: Calling an unavailable function triggers a JNI `FatalError` instead of an arbitrary segfault.
    * Avoids the intimidating crash log and writes a clean stack trace to `stderr`.

#### Fixes

- Generator: Fixed nullability of macro bindings.
- Generator: Fixed location of generated static blocks
- Core: Struct buffer `malloc/calloc` methods now support zero capacity, instead of throwing a `NPE`.
- macOS: Fixed version number detection in `.dylib` name mapping
- Nullability fixes in:
    * Assimp
    * CGL
    * Yoga
    * Parameters of struct multi-setter methods
- OpenCL: Fixed `CL_DEVICE_PREFERRED_VECTOR_WIDTH_INT` constant name.
- OpenCL: Dropped unnecessary `clSetKernalArg3<t>` overloads.
- OpenGL/GLES: The thread-local-free function pointer lookups do not depend on JVMTI anymore.
- stb: Fixed type of `stbi_write_jpg` function's `data` parameter. 

#### Breaking Changes

- Core: `MemoryUtil.MemoryAllocationReport` now also returns the address of the memory allocation.
- NanoVG: Parameters `windowWidth`/`windowHeight` of the `nvgBeginFrame` function changed to `float`.

#### Known Issues

- vma: The native library is not initialized automatically.
    * Workaround: call `Class.forName("org.lwjgl.util.vma.LibVma")` before using the VMA bindings.
- vma: `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` function addresses in `VmaVulkanFunctions` are not optional.
    * Workaround: Enable the `KHR_get_memory_requirements2` extension, or set the equivalent function addresses from Vulkan `1.1`.

### 3.1.6

    * Enables static analysis tools ([FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), IDEs) to detect accesses that could cause `NullPointerException`. Eliminating those improves the quality of LWJGL applications.
    * Enables better interopation with JVM-based languages that feature built-in null-safety. For example, see [Kotlin's JSR-305 support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html#jsr-305-support).
- Added `Configuration` setting to disable function lookup checks.
- lmdb: Databases are now binary compatible across 32 & 64-bit architectures. (#364)

    * Enables loading shared libraries from non-modular paths/JARs.
- JPMS: `module-info` files have been moved under `META-INF/version/9/` (#334)
    * All LWJGL artifacts are now multi-release JAR files to avoid trouble with older tools that are not compatible with Java 9.
- JPMS: Added appropriate `requires static` declarations to satisfy optional binding interop dependencies. (#369)
- Fixed broken javadoc links in all bindings. Also updated URLs to avoid redirects.
- bgfx: Restored default API thread encoder functions, that were erroneously removed in `3.1.4`.
- LibOVR: Fixed `ovr_TraceMessage` signature. 
- OpenAL: Fixed capability name of the `AL_SOFT_source_resampler` extension.
- Tootle: Fixed `pnClusterRemapOut` parameter validation.

#### Breaking Changes

- Several methods that previously accepted `null`/`NULL` and returned `null`, now require non-null input.
    * Applies to: struct & callback creation methods and `memByteBuffer`/`memUTF8`/`stack.UTF8`/etc.
    * Added corresponding methods with the `Safe` suffix that accept `null`/`NULL`, matching the old behavior.
    * With this change the common case (non-null input) requires no code changes and is warning/error-free. The uncommon case (null input) is recognizable (the suffix) and must be handled properly to eliminate warnings/errors. 
- Allocation methods that returned `null`/`NULL` on allocation failure, now throw `OutOfMemoryError` instead. This matches the behavior of `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect`.
    * Applies to: struct allocation methods and `memAlloc`/`memCalloc`/etc.
    * Does not apply to allocations via direct binding calls (e.g. `LibCStdlib.malloc`).
- Getters of struct members that should never be `NULL`, throw `NullPointerException` instead of returning `null` when the struct instance is not initialized.
    * Use `Struct::isNull` to test pointer members of untrusted struct instances.
- bgfx: Restored native mapping of `bgfx_init(_vendorId)` and `bgfx_update_texture_cube(_side)` parameters. (#368)
- bgfx: `uint16_t` bitfield constants are now mapped to `int`. (#368)
- glfw: `glfwInitHintString` has been renamed to `glfwWindowHintString`.
- lmdb: Databases developed on 32-bit architectures must be recreated. (#364)
- par_shapes: Changed `par_shapes_mesh::triangles` from `uint16_t/ShortBuffer` to `uint32_t/IntBuffer`. 
- stb_rect_pack: `stbrp_rect::was_packed` is now mapped to Java `boolean`.

    * Function parameters and return values.
- The default memory allocator on Windows is now the system allocator instead of jemalloc.
    * jemalloc is not properly optimized for Windows and its performance is not competitive.

### 3.0.0

_Released 2016 Jun 03_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added support for Java array parameters and HotSpot Critical Natives. (#175)
- Added [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) bindings. (#50)
- Added [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) bindings. (#99)
- Added [NativeFileDialog](https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog) bindings.
- Added [par_shapes.h](http://github.prideout.net/shapes) bindings.
- Added [dyncall](http://www.dyncall.org/) bindings.
- Added [jawt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_AWT_Native_Interface) bindings for AWT/Swing integration. (#125)
- Added simple OS-specific **window creation** bindings, for custom window/context creation. (#105)
- Added missing OpenCL and OpenAL **extensions**.
- **Fully documented** OpenCL and OpenAL.
- Moved **WGL** and **GLX** capabilities to the new `WGLCapabilities` and `GLXCapabilities` classes, respectively. Functionality in WGL, GLX and corresponding extensions that does not require a current context can now be used without creating a dummy context first. (#171)

#### Improvements

- Added **stack allocation** APIs (the `MemoryStack` class and new allocation methods in struct classes and `MemoryUtil`).
- Made the implementations of `PointerBuffer` and `Struct/StructBuffer` subclasses as lightweight as possible. This makes it easier for escape analysis to **eliminate allocations**.
- Minor struct API improvements.
- Added **nullability information** to **struct members**, to protect against buggy code crashing the JVM.
- All bindings are updated to the **latest versions** of the corresponding libraries. Notably, GLFW now has `glfwSetWindowIcon` and `glfwSetWindowMonitor`, it now doesn't lack anything compared to LWJGL 2's Display.
- Refactored callbacks for Java 8. (#182)
- Added `NativeResource` interface and made freeable objects usable as resources in try-with-resources statements. (#186)
- **Faster thread-local lookups** for the stack and current capabilities. New options in Configuration can be used to **complete eliminate** thread-local lookup in OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenAL, when it is known that only a single context will be used, or that all contexts will be compatible (same capabilities and same function pointers).
- Added `memSlice` for all buffers types in `MemoryUtil`. (#179)
- Refactored the `Configuration` class for type safety and added more options.
- **JDK 9** can now be used to build and run LWJGL.
- Javadoc is now generated with JDK 9. The API is fully indexed and **search** functionality is available. Also made multiple Javadoc formatting improvements.
- Improved debug diagnostics on startup and when loading the LWJGL shared library fails.
- Optimized `memSet` and `memCopy` for small buffers.

#### Fixes

- **Stopped** using **UPX** compression for binaries. This eliminates various integration issues and virus scanning false-positives.
- The `SharedLibraryLoader` now works with any shared library, not only libraries LWJGL knows about. (#176)

#### Breaking Changes

- LWJGL now requires **Java 8** to build and run. Certain custom interfaces have been replaced with `java.util.function` interfaces. (#177)
- **Dropped** support for **Linux x86**. (#162)
- **Dropped** libffi bindings.
- **Dropped** `ALDevice/ALContext` wrappers from OpenAL and `CLPlatform/CLDevice` wrappers from OpenCL. (#152)
- **Dropped** the `getInstance()` method from bindings loaded from shared libraries. Function pointers are now stored either in capabilities classes or in a nested **Functions** inner class.
- **Dropped** infrequently used method overloads in bindings. Full javadoc is now generated on (almost) all overloads.
- **Dropped** utility classes that were not useful.
- Added **AutoSize** support to **struct members**. Instance setters for the corresponding count/size members were removed to avoid bugs and confusion.
- Replaced `MemoryUtil.memFree(StructBuffer)` with `StructBuffer.free()`.
- Renamed `__ALIGNMENT` to `ALIGNOF` in struct classes.
- Removed `org.lwjgl.system.Retainable` interface. `Closure` and `FunctionProvider` subclasses are now destroyed using `.free()` instead of `.release()`.
- Moved **xxHash** and **SSE** bindings to the `org.lwjgl.util` package.
- Integer-boolean native types (0 or 1 are the only legal values) are now mapped to Java booleans. (#181)
- **Macros** without parameters are now generated as static final values, not methods.

### 3.0.0 Beta

[DOWNLOAD](https://build.lwjgl.org/release/3.0.0b/lwjgl-3.0.0b.zip)

_Released 2015 Nov 20_

This build includes the following changes:

* The API is now considered **stable**. There were several API changes, especially to struct and callback classes.
* Moved advanced functionality from the base package to the [system](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/tree/master/modules/lwjgl/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system) package. Public API in the system package may change between releases.
* Critical methods have been optimized for better performance and garbage elimination.
* JNI methods are now [deduplicated](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-generated/blob/master/core/src/generated/java/org/lwjgl/system/JNI.java) and struct layout is calculated in Java. This means much smaller shared libraries.
* Introduced the [Configuration](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/lwjgl/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system/Configuration.java) class that can be used to programmatically configure LWJGL.
* Introduced explicit memory management API, which is also used internally by LWJGL.
* Introduced a debug allocator that can be enabled for the explicit memory management API. It reports memory leaks with full stack-traces to the leaked allocations.
* All struct classes now have a corresponding [StructBuffer](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/lwjgl/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system/StructBuffer.java) implementation. Bindings now use Struct and StructBuffer parameters and return values, instead of ByteBuffer, which improves type safety.
* Struct fields and accessors are now documented.
* Many other fixes and minor features.

Changes to bindings:

* Removed obsolete OS-specific bindings.
* Added bindings to many OpenGL extensions that were missing in 3.0.0a.
* Added bindings to [jemalloc](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/).
* Added bindings to [EGL](https://www.khronos.org/egl).
* Added bindings to [OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/).
* Added bindings to [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash).
* The bindings to [LibOVR](https://developer.oculus.com/) were updated to 0.8.0.0 and are now included in the official build.
* Several other fixes and updates to existing bindings.

### 3.0.0 Alpha

[DOWNLOAD](https://build.lwjgl.org/release/3.0.0a/lwjgl-3.0.0a.zip) (not recommended)

_Released 2015 Jul 13_

The first official release. This build suffers from several bugs and the API is very different from subsequent releases.
