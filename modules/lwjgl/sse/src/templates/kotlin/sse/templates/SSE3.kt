        Causes the \"denormals are zero\" mode to be turned ON or OFF by setting the appropriate bit of the control register. DAZ treats denormal values used
        as input to floating-point instructions as zero.

        DAZ is very similar to FTZ in many ways. DAZ mode is a method of bypassing IEEE 754 methods of dealing with denormal floating-point numbers. This mode
        is less precise, but much faster and is typically used in applications like streaming media when minute differences in quality are essentially
        undetectable.
