 * <p>Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while
 * being backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any
 * sample set.</p>
