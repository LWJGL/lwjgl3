        While {@code ovr_RecenterTrackingOrigin} resets the tracking origin in reference to the HMD's current pose, {@code ovr_SpecifyTrackingOrigin} allows

        There are several use cases for this function. For example, if the application decides to limit the yaw, or translation of the recentered pose instead
        of directly using the HMD pose the application can query the current tracking state via #GetTrackingState(), and apply some limitations to the HMD pose
        because feeding this pose back into this function. Similarly, this can be used to "adjust the seating position" incrementally in apps that feature
