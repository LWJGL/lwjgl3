        rendering into these textures. Even though it is not recommended, if the application would like to treat the texture as a linear format and do
        linear-to-gamma conversion in GLSL, then the application can avoid calling "{@code glEnable(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB);}", but should still pass in an sRGB
        variant for the format. Failure to do so will cause the distortion compositor to apply incorrect gamma conversions leading to gamma-curve artifacts.
