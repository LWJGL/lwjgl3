        The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html\#VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations">VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations</a> extension defines the infrastructure and usage patterns for deferrable commands, but does not specify any commands as deferrable. This is left to additional dependent extensions. Commands <b>must</b> not be deferred unless the deferral is specifically allowed by another extension which depends on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html\#VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations">VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations</a>.

        <h5>Code Examples</h5>
        The following examples will illustrate the concept of deferrable operations using a hypothetical example. The command {@code vkDoSomethingExpensiveEXT} denotes a deferrable command. The structure stext:VkExpensiveOperationArgsEXT represents the arguments which it would normally accept.

        The following example illustrates how a vulkan application might request deferral of an expensive operation:

        <pre><code>
￿// create a deferred operation
￿VkDeferredOperationKHR hOp;
￿VkResult result = vkCreateDeferredOperationKHR(device, pCallbacks, &amp;hOp);
￿assert(result == VK_SUCCESS);
￿
￿result = vkDoSomethingExpensive(device, hOp, ...);
￿assert( result == VK_OPERATION_DEFERRED_KHR );
￿
￿// operation was deferred.  Execute it asynchronously
￿std::async::launch(
￿    [ hOp ] ( )
￿    {
￿        vkDeferredOperationJoinKHR(device, hOp);
￿
￿        result = vkGetDeferredOperationResultKHR(device, hOp);
￿
￿        // deferred operation is now complete.  'result' indicates success or failure
￿
￿        vkDestroyDeferredOperationKHR(device, hOp, pCallbacks);
￿    }
￿);</code></pre>

        The following example shows a subroutine which guarantees completion of a deferred operation, in the presence of multiple worker threads, and returns the result of the operation.

        <pre><code>
￿VkResult FinishDeferredOperation(VkDeferredOperationKHR hOp)
￿{
￿    // Attempt to join the operation until the implementation indicates that we should stop
￿
￿    VkResult result = vkDeferredOperationJoinKHR(device, hOp);
￿    while( result == VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR )
￿    {
￿        std::this_thread::yield();
￿        result = vkDeferredOperationJoinKHR(device, hOp);
￿    }
￿
￿    switch( result )
￿    {
￿    case VK_SUCCESS:
￿        {
￿            // deferred operation has finished.  Query its result
￿            result = vkGetDeferredOperationResultKHR(device, hOp);
￿        }
￿        break;
￿
￿    case VK_THREAD_DONE_KHR:
￿        {
￿            // deferred operation is being wrapped up by another thread
￿            //  wait for that thread to finish
￿            do
￿            {
￿                std::this_thread::yield();
￿                result = vkGetDeferredOperationResultKHR(device, hOp);
￿            } while( result == VK_NOT_READY );
￿        }
￿        break;
￿
￿    default:
￿        assert(false); // other conditions are illegal.
￿        break;
￿    }
￿
￿    return result;
￿}</code></pre>

        The returned value is the maximum number of threads that can usefully execute a deferred operation concurrently, reported for the state of the deferred operation at the point this command is called. This value is intended to be used to better schedule work onto available threads. Applications <b>can</b> join any number of threads to the deferred operation and expect it to eventually complete, though excessive joins <b>may</b> return #THREAD_DONE_KHR immediately, performing no useful work.

        If {@code operation} is complete, {@code vkGetDeferredOperationMaxConcurrencyKHR} returns zero.

        If {@code operation} is currently joined to any threads, the value returned by this command <b>may</b> immediately be out of date.

        If {@code operation} is pending, implementations <b>must</b> not return zero unless at least one thread is currently executing #DeferredOperationJoinKHR() on {@code operation}. If there are such threads, the implementation <b>should</b> return an estimate of the number of additional threads which it could profitably use.

        Implementations <b>may</b> return <code>2<sup>32</sup>-1</code> to indicate that the maximum concurrency is unknown and cannot be easily derived. Implementations <b>may</b> return values larger than the maximum concurrency available on the host CPU. In these situations, an application <b>should</b> clamp the return value rather than oversubscribing the machine.

        The recommended usage pattern for applications is to query this value once, after deferral, and schedule no more than the specified number of threads to join the operation.

This situation <b>may</b> occur when other threads executing #DeferredOperationJoinKHR() are about to complete {@code operation}, and the implementation is unable to partition the workload any further.</li>

This situation <b>may</b> occur if the operation encounters a temporary reduction in parallelism.
