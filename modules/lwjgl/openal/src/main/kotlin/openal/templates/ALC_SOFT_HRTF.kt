        Native bindings to the $specLinkOpenALSoft extension.

        This extension allows an application to request and determine the status of HRTF mixing. HRTF, or Head-Related Transfer Function, is a method of mixing
        3D audio for "true" 3D panning, typically using filters designed to simulate how sound is affected by a listener's head as the sound waves travel
        between the ears.

        As a 3D sound API, OpenAL's design allows implementations to transparently render audio using HRTF. However, the OpenAL API currently has no concept of
        HRTF so there's no way to query if it's being used, and no way for an application to request it on behalf of the user. This aims to fix that.
