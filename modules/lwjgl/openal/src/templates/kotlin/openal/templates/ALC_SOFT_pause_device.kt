        Native bindings to the $specLinkOpenALSoft extension.

        This extension allows applications to pause a playback device. The main purpose of this is to silence output, stop processing, and allow the audio
        hardware to go into a low-power mode. On a mobile device, for instance, apps may want to silence output and not waste battery life with unneeded
        processing when in the background.

        Pauses a playback device.

        When paused, no contexts associated with the device will be processed or updated. Playing sources will not produce sound, have their offsets
        incremented, or process any more buffers, until the device is resumed. Pausing a device that is already paused is a legal no-op.
