        Bindings to ${url("https://symas.com/lmdb/", "LMDB")}, the Symas Lightning Memory-Mapped Database.

        LMDB is a Btree-based database management library modeled loosely on the BerkeleyDB API, but much simplified. The entire database is exposed in a
        memory map, and all data fetches return data directly from the mapped memory, so no malloc's or memcpy's occur during data fetches. As such, the
        library is extremely simple because it requires no page caching layer of its own, and it is extremely high performance and memory-efficient. It is also
        fully transactional with full ACID semantics, and when the memory map is read-only, the database integrity cannot be corrupted by stray pointer writes
        from application code.

        The library is fully thread-aware and supports concurrent read/write access from multiple processes and threads. Data pages use a copy-on-write
        strategy so no active data pages are ever overwritten, which also provides resistance to corruption and eliminates the need of any special recovery
        procedures after a system crash. Writes are fully serialized; only one write transaction may be active at a time, which guarantees that writers can
        never deadlock. The database structure is multi-versioned so readers run with no locks; writers cannot block readers, and readers don't block writers.

        Unlike other well-known database mechanisms which use either write-ahead transaction logs or append-only data writes, LMDB requires no maintenance
        during operation. Both write-ahead loggers and append-only databases require periodic checkpointing and/or compaction of their log or database files
        otherwise they grow without bound. LMDB tracks free pages within the database and re-uses them for new write operations, so the database size does not
        grow without bound in normal use.

        The memory map can be used as a read-only or read-write map. It is read-only by default as this provides total immunity to corruption. Using read-write
        mode offers much higher write performance, but adds the possibility for stray application writes thru pointers to silently corrupt the database. Of
        course if your application code is known to be bug-free (...) then this is not an issue.

        <h3>Reader Lock Table</h3>

        Readers don't acquire any locks for their data access. Instead, they simply record their transaction ID in the reader table. The reader mutex is needed
        just to find an empty slot in the reader table. The slot's address is saved in thread-specific data so that subsequent read transactions started by the
        same thread need no further locking to proceed.

        If #NOTLS is set, the slot address is not saved in thread-specific data.

        No reader table is used if the database is on a read-only filesystem, or if #NOLOCK is set.

        Since the database uses multi-version concurrency control, readers don't actually need any locking. This table is used to keep track of which readers
        are using data from which old transactions, so that we'll know when a particular old transaction is no longer in use. Old transactions that have
        discarded any data pages can then have those pages reclaimed for use by a later write transaction.

        The lock table is constructed such that reader slots are aligned with the processor's cache line size. Any slot is only ever used by one thread. This
        alignment guarantees that there will be no contention or cache thrashing as threads update their own slot info, and also eliminates any need for
        locking when accessing a slot.

        A writer thread will scan every slot in the table to determine the oldest outstanding reader transaction. Any freed pages older than this will be
        reclaimed by the writer. The writer doesn't use any locks when scanning this table. This means that there's no guarantee that the writer will see the
        most up-to-date reader info, but that's not required for correct operation - all we need is to know the upper bound on the oldest reader, we don't care
        at all about the newest reader. So the only consequence of reading stale information here is that old pages might hang around a while longer before
        being reclaimed. That's actually good anyway, because the longer we delay reclaiming old pages, the more likely it is that a string of contiguous pages
        can be found after coalescing old pages from many old transactions together.
