        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        LMDB is compact, fast, powerful, and robust and implements a simplified variant of the BerkeleyDB (BDB) API.

        Everything starts with an environment, created by #env_create(). Once created, this environment must also be opened with #env_open(). #env_open() gets
        passed a name which is interpreted as a directory path. Note that this directory must exist already, it is not created for you. Within that directory,
        a lock file and a storage file will be generated. If you don't want to use a directory, you can pass the #NOSUBDIR option, in which case the path you
        provided is used directly as the data file, and another file with a "-lock" suffix added will be used for the lock file.

        Once the environment is open, a transaction can be created within it using #txn_begin(). Transactions may be read-write or read-only, and read-write
        transactions may be nested. A transaction must only be used by one thread at a time. Transactions are always required, even for read-only access. The
        transaction provides a consistent view of the data.

        Once a transaction has been created, a database can be opened within it using #dbi_open(). If only one database will ever be used in the environment, a
        #NULL can be passed as the database name. For named databases, the #CREATE flag must be used to create the database if it doesn't already exist. Also,
        #env_set_maxdbs() must be called after #env_create() and before #env_open() to set the maximum number of named databases you want to support.

        Note: a single transaction can open multiple databases. Generally databases should only be opened once, by the first transaction in the process. After
        the first transaction completes, the database handles can freely be used by all subsequent transactions.

        Within a transaction, #get() and #put() can store single key/value pairs if that is all you need to do (but see {@code Cursors} below if you want to do
        more).

        A key/value pair is expressed as two ##MDBVal structures. This struct has two fields, {@code mv_size} and {@code mv_data}. The data is a {@code void}
        pointer to an array of {@code mv_size} bytes.

        Because LMDB is very efficient (and usually zero-copy), the data returned in an ##MDBVal structure may be memory-mapped straight from disk. In other
        words <b>look but do not touch</b> (or {@code free()} for that matter). Once a transaction is closed, the values can no longer be used, so make a copy
        if you need to keep them after that.

        <h3>Cursors</h3>

        To do more powerful things, we must use a cursor.

        Within the transaction, a cursor can be created with #cursor_open(). With this cursor we can store/retrieve/delete (multiple) values using
        #cursor_get(), #cursor_put(), and #cursor_del().

        #cursor_get() positions itself depending on the cursor operation requested, and for some operations, on the supplied key. For example, to list all
        key/value pairs in a database, use operation #FIRST for the first call to #cursor_get(), and #NEXT on subsequent calls, until the end is hit.

        To retrieve all keys starting from a specified key value, use #SET.

        When using #cursor_put(), either the function will position the cursor for you based on the {@code key}, or you can use operation #CURRENT to use the
        current position of the cursor. Note that {@code key} must then match the current position's key.

        <h4>Summarizing the Opening</h4>

        So we have a cursor in a transaction which opened a database in an environment which is opened from a filesystem after it was separately created.

        Or, we create an environment, open it from a filesystem, create a transaction within it, open a database within that transaction, and create a cursor
        within all of the above.

        <h3>Threads and Processes</h3>

        LMDB uses POSIX locks on files, and these locks have issues if one process opens a file multiple times. Because of this, do not #env_open() a file
        multiple times from a single process. Instead, share the LMDB environment that has opened the file across all threads. Otherwise, if a single process
        opens the same environment multiple times, closing it once will remove all the locks held on it, and the other instances will be vulnerable to
        corruption from other processes.

        Also note that a transaction is tied to one thread by default using Thread Local Storage. If you want to pass read-only transactions across threads,
        you can use the #NOTLS option on the environment.

        <h3><Transactions, Rollbacks, etc.</h3>

        To actually get anything done, a transaction must be committed using #txn_commit(). Alternatively, all of a transaction's operations can be discarded
        using #txn_abort(). In a read-only transaction, any cursors will <b>not</b> automatically be freed. In a read-write transaction, all cursors will be
        freed and must not be used again.

        For read-only transactions, obviously there is nothing to commit to storage. The transaction still must eventually be aborted to close any database
        handle(s) opened in it, or committed to keep the database handles around for reuse in new transactions.

        In addition, as long as a transaction is open, a consistent view of the database is kept alive, which requires storage. A read-only transaction that no
        longer requires this consistent view should be terminated (committed or aborted) when the view is no longer needed (but see below for an optimization).

        There can be multiple simultaneously active read-only transactions but only one that can write. Once a single read-write transaction is opened, all
        further attempts to begin one will block until the first one is committed or aborted. This has no effect on read-only transactions, however, and they
        may continue to be opened at any time.

        <h3>Duplicate Keys</h3>

        #get() and #put() respectively have no and only some support for multiple key/value pairs with identical keys. If there are multiple values for a key,
        #get() will only return the first value.

        When multiple values for one key are required, pass the #DUPSORT flag to #dbi_open(). In an #DUPSORT database, by default #put() will not replace the
        value for a key if the key existed already. Instead it will add the new value to the key. In addition, #del() will pay attention to the value field
        too, allowing for specific values of a key to be deleted.

        Finally, additional cursor operations become available for traversing through and retrieving duplicate values.

        <h3>Some Optimization</h3>

        If you frequently begin and abort read-only transactions, as an optimization, it is possible to only reset and renew a transaction.

        #txn_reset() releases any old copies of data kept around for a read-only transaction. To reuse this reset transaction, call #txn_renew() on it. Any
        cursors in this transaction must also be renewed using #cursor_renew().

        Note that #txn_reset() is similar to #txn_abort() and will close any databases you opened within the transaction.

        To permanently free a transaction, reset or not, use #txn_abort().

        <h3>Cleaning Up</h3>

        For read-only transactions, any cursors created within it must be closed using #cursor_close().

        It is very rarely necessary to close a database handle, and in general they should just be left open.

                many other system libraries may allocate and free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap for file I/O buffers.
                This initialization step has a modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable it using this flag. This option can be a
                problem for applications which handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed
                with #WRITEMAP, which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The initialization is also skipped if #RESERVE is used;
                the caller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was reserved in that case.

                This flag may be changed at any time using #env_set_flags().
