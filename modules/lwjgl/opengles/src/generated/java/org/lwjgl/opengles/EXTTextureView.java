/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_view.txt">EXT_texture_view</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows a texture's data store to be "viewed" in multiple ways, either reinterpreting the data format/type as a different format/ type
 * with the same element size, or by clamping the mipmap level range or array slice range.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The goals of this extension are to avoid having these alternate views become shared mutable containers of shared mutable objects, and to add the views
 * to the API in a minimally invasive way.</p>
 * 
 * <p>No new object types are added. Conceptually, a texture object is split into the following parts:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>A data store holding texel data.</li>
 * <li>State describing which portions of the data store to use, and how to interpret the data elements.</li>
 * <li>An embedded sampler object.</li>
 * <li>Various other texture parameters.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>With this extension, multiple textures can share a data store and have different state describing which portions of the data store to use and how to
 * interpret the data elements. The data store is refcounted and not destroyed until the last texture sharing it is deleted.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension leverages the concept of an "immutable texture". Views can only be created of textures created with TexStorage*.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES30 GLES 3.0}.</p>
