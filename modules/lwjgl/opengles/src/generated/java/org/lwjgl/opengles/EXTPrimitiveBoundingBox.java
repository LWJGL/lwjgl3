/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_primitive_bounding_box.txt">EXT_primitive_bounding_box</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>On tile-based architectures, transformed primitives are generally written out to memory before rasterization, and then read back from memory for each
 * tile they intersect. When geometry expands during transformation due to tessellation or one-to-many geometry shaders, the external bandwidth required
 * grows proportionally. This extension provides a way for implementations to know which tiles incoming geometry will intersect before fully transforming
 * (and expanding) the geometry. This allows them to only store the unexpanded geometry in memory, and perform expansion on-chip for each intersected
 * tile.</p>
 * 
 * <p>New state is added to hold an axis-aligned bounding box which is assumed to contain any geometry submitted. An implementation is allowed to ignore any
 * portions of primitives outside the bounding box; thus if a primitive extends outside of a tile into a neighboring tile that the bounding box didn't
 * intersect, the implementation is not required to render those portions. The tessellation control shader is optionally able to specify a per-patch
 * bounding box that overrides the bounding box state for primitives generated from that patch, in order to provide tighter bounds.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The typical usage is that an application will have an object-space bounding volume for a primitive or group of primitives, either calculated at runtime
 * or provided with the mesh by the authoring tool or content pipeline. It will transform this volume to clip space, compute an axis-aligned bounding box
 * that contains the transformed bounding volume, and provide that at either per-patch or per-draw granularity.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GLES31 GLES 3.1}.</p>
