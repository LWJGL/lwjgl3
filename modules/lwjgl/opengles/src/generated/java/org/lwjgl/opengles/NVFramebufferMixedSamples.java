/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples.txt">NV_framebuffer_mixed_samples</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows multisample rendering with a raster and depth/stencil sample count that is larger than the color sample count. Rasterization and
 * the results of the depth and stencil tests together determine the portion of a pixel that is "covered". It can be useful to evaluate coverage at a
 * higher frequency than color samples are stored. This coverage is then "reduced" to a collection of covered color samples, each having an opacity value
 * corresponding to the fraction of the color sample covered. The opacity can optionally be blended into individual color samples.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In the current hardware incarnation both depth and stencil testing are supported with mixed samples, although the API accommodates supporting only one
 * or the other.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Rendering with fewer color samples than depth/stencil samples can greatly reduce the amount of memory and bandwidth consumed by the color buffer.
 * However, converting the coverage values into opacity can introduce artifacts where triangles share edges and may not be suitable for normal triangle
 * mesh rendering.</p>
 * 
 * <p>One expected use case for this functionality is Stencil-then-Cover path rendering (NV_path_rendering). The stencil step determines the coverage (in the
 * stencil buffer) for an entire path at the higher sample frequency, and then the cover step can draw the path into the lower frequency color buffer
 * using the coverage information to antialias path edges. With this two-step process, internal edges are fully covered when antialiasing is applied and
 * there is no corruption on these edges.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The key features of this extension are:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>It allows a framebuffer object to be considered complete when its depth or stencil samples are a multiple of the number of color samples.</li>
 * <li>It redefines SAMPLES to be the number of depth/stencil samples (if any); otherwise, it uses the number of color samples. SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one if
 * there are multisample depth/stencil attachments. Multisample rasterization and multisample fragment ops are allowed if SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one.</li>
 * <li>It replaces several error checks involving SAMPLE_BUFFERS by error checks directly referencing the number of samples in the relevant attachments.</li>
 * <li>A coverage reduction step is added to Per-Fragment Operations which converts a set of covered raster/depth/stencil samples to a set of covered
 * color samples. The coverage reduction step also includes an optional coverage modulation step, multiplying color values by a fractional opacity
 * corresponding to the number of associated raster/depth/stencil samples covered.</li>
 * </ul>
