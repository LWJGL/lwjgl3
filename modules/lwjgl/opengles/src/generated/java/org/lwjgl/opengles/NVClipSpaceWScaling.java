/**
 * Virtual Reality (VR) applications often involve a post-processing step to apply a "barrel" distortion to the rendered image to correct the "pincushion"
 * distortion introduced by the optics in a VR device. The barrel distorted image has lower resolution along the edges compared to the center. Since the
 * original image is rendered at high resolution, which is uniform across the complete image, a lot of pixels towards the edges do not make it to the
 * final post-processed image.
 * 
 * <p>This extension also provides a mechanism to render VR scenes at a non-uniform resolution, in particular a resolution that falls linearly from the
 * center towards the edges. This is achieved by scaling the "w" coordinate of the vertices in the clip space before perspective divide. The clip space
 * "w" coordinate of the vertices may be offset as of a function of "x" and "y" coordinates as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * w' = w + Ax + By</code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>In the intended use case for viewport position scaling, an application should use a set of 4 viewports, one for each of the 4 quadrants of a Cartesian
 * coordinate system. Each viewport is set to the dimension of the image, but is scissored to the quadrant it represents. The application should specify A
 * and B coefficients of the w-scaling equation above, that have the same value, but different signs, for each of the viewports. The signs of A and B
 * should match the signs of X and Y for the quadrant that they represent such that the value of "w'" will always be greater than or equal to the original
 * "w" value for the entire image. Since the offset to "w", (Ax + By), is always positive and increases with the absolute values of "x" and "y", the
 * effective resolution will fall off linearly from the center of the image to its edges.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link NVViewportArray NV_viewport_array} or {@link OESViewportArray OES_viewport_array}.</p>
