/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_buffer.txt">EXT_texture_buffer</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension provides a new texture type, called a buffer texture. Buffer textures are one-dimensional arrays of texels whose storage comes from an
 * attached buffer object. When a buffer object is bound to a buffer texture, a format is specified, and the data in the buffer object is treated as an
 * array of texels of the specified format.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The use of a buffer object to provide storage allows the texture data to be specified in a number of different ways: via buffer object loads
 * (BufferData), direct CPU writes (MapBuffer), or framebuffer readbacks to pixel buffer objects (ReadPixels). A buffer object can also be loaded by
 * transform feedback, which captures selected transformed attributes of vertices processed by the GL. Several of these mechanisms do not require an extra
 * data copy, which would be required when using conventional TexImage-like entry points.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Buffer textures do not support mipmapping, texture lookups with normalized floating-point texture coordinates, and texture filtering of any sort. They
 * can be accessed via single texel fetch operations in programmable shaders, using a new sampler type and texel fetch function, and access can be
 * controlled using the same memory barrier operations as for other texture types.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Buffer textures are treated as (potentially large) one-dimensional textures; the maximum texture size supported for buffer textures in the initial
 * implementation of this extension is 2<sup>27</sup> texels (note that this extension only guarantees support for buffer textures with 2<sup>16</sup>
 * texels, but we expect most implementations to exceed that substantially). When a buffer object is attached to a buffer texture, a size is not
 * specified; rather, the number of texels in the texture is taken by dividing the size of the buffer object by the size of each texel.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension also allows a sub-range of the buffer's data store to be attached to a texture. This can be used, for example, to allow multiple buffer
 * textures to be backed by independent sub-ranges of the same buffer object, or for different sub-ranges of a single buffer object to be used for
 * different purposes.</p>
