        When #CONSERVATIVE_RASTERIZATION_NV is enabled, the fragments generated for a primitive are conservative with respect to the primitive after snapping
        to sub-pixel grid. This extension provides a new mode of rasterization for triangles where the fragments generated are conservative with respect to the
        primitive at infinite precision before vertex snapping.

        When the conservative raster mode is set to #CONSERVATIVE_RASTER_MODE_PRE_SNAP_TRIANGLES_NV, triangles are rasterized more conservatively, and may
        generate fragments not generated when the mode is #CONSERVATIVE_RASTER_MODE_POST_SNAP_NV (default). In particular it may generate fragments for pixels
        covered by triangles with zero area, or for pixels that are adjacent to but not covered by any triangle. This modified behavior may be useful in
        compensating for rounding errors caused by snapping vertex positions to a sub-pixel grid during rasterization. It's possible that a non-degenerate
        triangle becomes degenerate due to snapping. It's additionally possible that rounding errors in computing the position of a vertex or from snapping may
        cause a primitive that would cover a pixel at infinite precision to fail to cover the pixel post-snap. Rasterizing such primitives more conservatively
        may be useful for "binning" algorithms described in ${NV_conservative_raster.link}.
