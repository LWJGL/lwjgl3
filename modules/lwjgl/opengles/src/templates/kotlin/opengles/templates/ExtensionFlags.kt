        This extension provides new built-in functions to compute the composite of a set of boolean conditions across a group of shader invocations. These
        composite results may be used to execute shaders more efficiently on a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) processor. The set of shader invocations
        across which boolean conditions are evaluated is implementation-dependent, and this extension provides no guarantee over how individual shader
        invocations are assigned to such sets. In particular, the set of shader invocations has no necessary relationship with the compute shader local work
        group -- a pair of shader invocations in a single compute shader work group may end up in different sets used by these built-ins.

        Compute shaders operate on an explicitly specified group of threads (a local work group), but many implementations of OpenGL ES 3.0 will even group
        non-compute shader invocations and execute them in a SIMD fashion. When executing code like
        ${codeBlock("""

        is true and leave the other invocations dormant. Once do_fast_path() returns, it might call do_general_path() for invocations where {@code condition}
        is false and leave the other invocations dormant. In this case, the shader executes *both* the fast and the general path and might be better off just
        using the general path for all invocations.

        This extension provides the ability to avoid divergent execution by evaluting a condition across an entire SIMD invocation group using code like:
        ${codeBlock("""
if (allInvocationsEXT(condition)) {
    result = do_fast_path();
} else {

        The built-in function allInvocationsEXT() will return the same value for all invocations in the group, so the group will either execute do_fast_path()
        or do_general_path(), but never both. For example, shader code might want to evaluate a complex function iteratively by starting with an approximation
        of the result and then refining the approximation. Some input values may require a small number of iterations to generate an accurate result
        (do_fast_path) while others require a larger number (do_general_path). In another example, shader code might want to evaluate a complex function
        (do_general_path) that can be greatly simplified when assuming a specific value for one of its inputs (do_fast_path).

        )}
        This extension provides new GLSL built-in functions beginInvocationInterlockNV() and endInvocationInterlockNV() that delimit a critical section of
        fragment shader code. For pairs of shader invocations with "overlapping" coverage in a given pixel, the OpenGL implementation will guarantee that the
        critical section of the fragment shader will be executed for only one fragment at a time.

        There are four different interlock modes supported by this extension, which are identified by layout qualifiers. The qualifiers
        "pixel_interlock_ordered" and "pixel_interlock_unordered" provides mutual exclusion in the critical section for any pair of fragments corresponding to
        the same pixel. When using multisampling, the qualifiers "sample_interlock_ordered" and "sample_interlock_unordered" only provide mutual exclusion for
        pairs of fragments that both cover at least one common sample in the same pixel; these are recommended for performance if shaders use per-sample data
        structures.

        Additionally, when the "pixel_interlock_ordered" or "sample_interlock_ordered" layout qualifier is used, the interlock also guarantees that the
        critical section for multiple shader invocations with "overlapping" coverage will be executed in the order in which the primitives were processed by
        the GL. Such a guarantee is useful for applications like blending in the fragment shader, where an application requires that fragment values to be
        composited in the framebuffer in primitive order.

        This extension can be useful for algorithms that need to access per-pixel data structures via shader loads and stores. Such algorithms using this
        extension can access such data structures in the critical section without worrying about other invocations for the same pixel accessing the data
        structures concurrently. Additionally, the ordering guarantees are useful for cases where the API ordering of fragments is meaningful. For example,
        applications may be able to execute programmable blending operations in the fragment shader, where the destination buffer is read via image loads and
        the final value is written via image stores.

        When true, the $registryLink extension is supported.

        Geometry shaders provide the ability for applications to process each primitive sent through the GL using a programmable shader. While geometry shaders
        can be used to perform a number of different operations, including subdividing primitives and changing primitive type, one common use case treats
        geometry shaders as largely "passthrough". In this use case, the bulk of the geometry shader code simply copies inputs from each vertex of the input
        primitive to corresponding outputs in the vertices of the output primitive. Such shaders might also compute values for additional built-in or
        user-defined per-primitive attributes (e.g., gl_Layer) to be assigned to all the vertices of the output primitive.

        This extension provides a shading language abstraction to express such shaders without requiring explicit logic to manually copy attributes from input
        vertices to output vertices. For example, consider the following simple geometry shader in unextended OpenGL:
        ${codeBlock("""
      layout(triangles) in;
      layout(triangle_strip) out;
      layout(max_vertices=3) out;

      in Inputs {
        vec2 texcoord;
        vec4 baseColor;
      } v_in[];
      out Outputs {
        vec2 texcoord;
        vec4 baseColor;
      };

      void main()
      {
        int layer = compute_layer();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          gl_Position = gl_in[i].gl_Position;
          texcoord = v_in[i].texcoord;
          baseColor = v_in[i].baseColor;
          gl_Layer = layer;
          EmitVertex();
        }
      }""")}
        In this shader, the inputs "gl_Position", "Inputs.texcoord", and "Inputs.baseColor" are simply copied from the input vertex to the corresponding output
        vertex. The only "interesting" work done by the geometry shader is computing and emitting a gl_Layer value for the primitive.

        The following geometry shader, using this extension, is equivalent:
        ${codeBlock("""
      \#extension GL_NV_geometry_shader_passthrough : require

      layout(triangles) in;
      // No output primitive layout qualifiers required.

        Virtual reality (VR) applications often render a single logical scene from multiple views corresponding to a pair of eyes. The views (eyes) are

        Traditionally, multiple views are rendered via multiple rendering passes. This is expensive for the GPU because the objects in the scene must be
        transformed, rasterized, shaded, and fragment processed redundantly. This is expensive for the CPU because the scene graph needs to be visited multiple
        times and driver validation happens for each view. Rendering N passes tends to take N times longer than a single pass.

        This extension provides a mechanism to render binocular (stereo) views from a single stream of OpenGL rendering commands. Vertex, tessellation, and
