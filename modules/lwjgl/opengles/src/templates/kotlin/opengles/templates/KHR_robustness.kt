        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        Several recent trends in how OpenGL ES integrates into modern computer systems have created new requirements for robustness and security for GL
        rendering contexts.

        Additionally GPU architectures now support hardware fault detection; for example, video memory supporting ECC (error correcting codes) and error
        detection. GL contexts should be capable of recovering from hardware faults such as uncorrectable memory errors. Along with recovery from such hardware
        faults, the recovery mechanism can also allow recovery from video memory access exceptions and system software failures. System software failures can
        be due to device changes or driver failures.

        GL queries that return (write) some number of bytes to a buffer indicated by a pointer parameter introduce risk of buffer overflows that might be
        exploitable by malware. To address this, queries with return value sizes that are not expressed directly by the parameters to the query itself are
        given additional API functions with an additional parameter that specifies the number of bytes in the buffer and never writing bytes beyond that limit.
        This is particularly useful for multi-threaded usage of GL contexts in a "share group" where one context can change objects in ways that can cause
        buffer overflows for another context's GL queries.

        The original ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension includes an issue that explicitly states program termination is allowed when out-of-bounds vertex
        buffer object fetches occur. Modern graphics hardware is capable of well-defined behavior in the case of out-of- bounds vertex buffer object fetches.
        Older hardware may require extra checks to enforce well-defined (and termination free) behavior, but this expense is warranted when processing
        potentially untrusted content.

        The intent of this extension is to address some specific robustness goals:
        ${ul(
            """
            For all existing GL queries, provide additional "safe" APIs that limit data written to user pointers to a buffer size in bytes that is an explicit

            Provide a mechanism for a GL application to learn about graphics resets that affect the context. When a graphics reset occurs, the GL context

            reads of uniforms or parameters from buffers.

        If a reset status other than NO_ERROR is returned and subsequent calls return NO_ERROR, the context reset was encountered and completed. If a reset
        status is repeatedly returned, the context may be in the process of resetting.

        Reset notification behavior is determined at context creation time, and may be queried by calling GetIntegerv with the symbolic constant
        #RESET_NOTIFICATION_STRATEGY_KHR.

        If the reset notification behavior is #NO_RESET_NOTIFICATION_KHR, then the implementation will never deliver notification of reset events, and
        GetGraphicsResetStatus will always return NO_ERROR.

        If the behavior is #LOSE_CONTEXT_ON_RESET_KHR, a graphics reset will result in a lost context and require creating a new context as described
        above. In this case GetGraphicsResetStatus will return an appropriate value from those described above.

        If a graphics reset notification occurs in a context, a notification must also occur in all other contexts which share objects with that context.

        #CONTEXT_LOST_KHR error. Such commands will not have side effects (in particular, they will not modify memory passed by pointer for query results,
