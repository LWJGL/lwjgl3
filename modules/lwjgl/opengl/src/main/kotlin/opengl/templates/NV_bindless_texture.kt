        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension allows OpenGL applications to access texture objects in
        shaders without first binding each texture to one of a limited number of
        texture image units.  Using this extension, an application can query a
        64-bit unsigned integer texture handle for each texture that it wants to
        access and then use that handle directly in GLSL or assembly-based
        shaders.  The ability to access textures without having to bind and/or
        re-bind them is similar to the capability provided by the
        NV_shader_buffer_load extension that allows shaders to access buffer
        objects without binding them.  In both cases, these extensions
        significantly reduce the amount of API and internal GL driver overhead
        needed to manage resource bindings.

        This extension also provides similar capability for the image load, store,
        and atomic functionality provided by OpenGL 4.2, OpenGL ES 3.1 and the
        ARB_shader_image_load_store and EXT_shader_image_load_store extensions,
        where a texture can be accessed without first binding it to an image unit.
        An image handle can be extracted from a texture object using an API with a
        set of parameters similar to those for BindImageTextureEXT.

        This extension adds no new data types to GLSL.  Instead, it uses existing
        sampler and image data types and allows them to be populated with texture
        and image handles.  This extension does permit sampler and image data
        types to be used in more contexts than in unextended GLSL 4.00.  In
        particular, sampler and image types may be used as shader inputs/outputs,
        temporary variables, and uniform block members, and may be assigned to by
        shader code.  Constructors are provided to convert 64-bit unsigned integer
        values to and from sampler and image data types.  Additionally, new APIs
        are provided to load values for sampler and image uniforms with 64-bit
        handle inputs.  The use of existing integer-based Uniform* APIs is still
        permitted, in which case the integer specified will identify a texture
        image or image unit.  For samplers and images with values specified as
        texture image or image units, the GL implemenation will translate the unit
        number to an internal handle as required.

        To access texture or image resources using handles, the handles must first
        be made resident.  Accessing a texture or image by handle without first
        making it resident can result in undefined results, including program
        termination.  Since the amount of texture memory required by an
        application may exceed the amount of memory available to the system, this
        extension provides API calls allowing applications to manage overall
        texture memory consumption by making a texture resident and non-resident
        as required.
