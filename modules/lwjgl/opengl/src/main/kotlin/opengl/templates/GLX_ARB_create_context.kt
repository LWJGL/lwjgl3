        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        With the advent of new versions of OpenGL which deprecate features and/or break backward compatibility with older versions, there is a need and desire
        to indicate at context creation which interface will be used. These extensions add a new context creation routine with attributes specifying the GL
        version and context properties requested for the context, and additionally add an attribute specifying the GL profile requested for a context of OpenGL
        3.2 or later. It also allows making an OpenGL 3.0 or later context current without providing a default framebuffer.

        Requires ${GLX14.glx}.
