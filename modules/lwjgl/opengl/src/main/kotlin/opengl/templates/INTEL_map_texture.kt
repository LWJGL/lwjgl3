        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        Systems with integrated GPUs can share the same physical memory between CPU and GPU. This feature, if exposed by API, can bring significant performance
        benefits for graphics applications by reducing the complexity of uploading/accessing texture contents. This extension enables CPU direct access to the
        GPU memory holding textures.

        The problem with texture memory directly exposed to clients is that textures are often 'tiled'. Texels are kept in specific layout to improve locality
        of reference and thus performance of texturing. This 'tiling' is specific to particular hardware and would be thus difficult to use.

        This extension allows to create textures with 'linear' layout which allows for simplified access on user side (potentially sacrificing some performance
        during texture sampling).

        Requires ${GL30.core}.

        command if such flush is not needed.

        It is worth noting that this extension does not address automatic synchronization between CPU and GPU when both entities operate on the same texture at
        the same time. This is up to the application to assure such synchronization. Otherwise, the results may not be deterministic (writes from different
        entities may interleave in a non-deterministic way).
