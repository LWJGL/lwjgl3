        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        On systems with more than one GPU it is desirable to be able to select which GPU(s) in the system become the target for OpenGL rendering commands. This
        extension introduces the concept of a GPU affinity mask. OpenGL rendering commands are directed to the GPU(s) specified by the affinity mask. GPU
        affinity is immutable. Once set, it cannot be changed.

        This extension also introduces the concept called affinity-DC. An affinity-DC is a device context with a GPU affinity mask embedded in it. This
        restricts the device context to only allow OpenGL commands to be sent to the GPU(s) in the affinity mask.
