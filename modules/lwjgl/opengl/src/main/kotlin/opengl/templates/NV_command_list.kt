        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension adds a few new features designed to provide very low overhead batching and replay of rendering commands and state changes:
        ${ul(
            "A state object, which stores a pre-validated representation of the state of (almost) the entire pipeline.",
            """
            A more flexible and extensible MultiDrawIndirect (MDI) type of mechanism, using a token-based command stream, allowing to setup binding state and
            emit draw calls.
            """,
            "A set of functions to execute a list of the token-based command streams with state object changes interleaved with the streams.",
            "Command lists enabling compilation and reuse of sequences of command streams and state object changes."
        )}

        Because state objects reflect the state of the entire pipeline, it is expected that they can be pre-validated and executed efficiently. It is also
        expected that when state objects are combined into a command list, the command list can diff consecutive state objects to produce a reduced/ optimized
        set of state changes specific to that transition.

        The token-based command stream can also be stored in regular buffer objects and therefore be modified by the server itself. This allows more complex
        work creation than the original MDI approach, which was limited to emitting draw calls only.
