        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        OpenGL 4.3 (with the introduction of the ${ARB_multi_draw_indirect.link} extension) enhanced the ability of OpenGL to allow a large sets of parameters
        for indirect draws (introduced with OpenGL 4.0) into a buffer object and dispatch the entire list with one API call. This allows, for example, a shader
        (such as a compute shader via shader storage buffers, or a geometry shader via transform feedback) to produce lists of draw commands that can then be
        consumed by OpenGL without a server-client round trip. However, when a variable and potentially unknown number of draws are produced by such a shader,
        it becomes difficult to know how many draws are in the output array(s). Applications must resort to techniques such as transform feedback primitive
        queries, or mapping buffers containing the content of atomic counters, which can cause stalls or bubbles in the OpenGL pipeline.

        This extension introduces the concept of the "parameter buffer", which is a target allowing buffers to store parameters for certain drawing commands.
        Also in this extension, new variants of #MultiDrawArraysIndirect() and #MultiDrawElementsIndirect() are introduced that source some of their
        parameters from this buffer. Further commands could potentially be introduced that source other parameters from a buffer.

        Requires ${GL42.core}.
