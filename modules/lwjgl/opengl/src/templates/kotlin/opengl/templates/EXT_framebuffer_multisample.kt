        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension extends the EXT_framebuffer_object framework to enable multisample rendering.

        The new operation RenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT() allocates storage for a renderbuffer object that can be used as a multisample buffer. A
        multisample render buffer image differs from a single-sample render buffer image in that a multisample image has a number of SAMPLES that is greater
        than zero. No method is provided for creating multisample texture images.

        All of the framebuffer-attachable images attached to a framebuffer object must have the same number of SAMPLES or else the framebuffer object is not
        "framebuffer complete". If a framebuffer object with multisample attachments is "framebuffer complete", then the framebuffer object behaves as if
        SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one.

        In traditional multisample rendering, where DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT is zero and SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, the GL spec states that "the color sample
        values are resolved to a single, displayable color each time a pixel is updated." There are, however, several modern hardware implementations that do
        not actually resolve for each sample update, but instead postpones the resolve operation to a later time and resolve a batch of sample updates at a
        time. This is OK as long as the implementation behaves "as if" it had resolved a sample-at-a-time. Unfortunately, however, honoring the "as if" rule can
        sometimes degrade performance.

        In contrast, when DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING_EXT is an application-created framebuffer object, MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and SAMPLE_BUFFERS is one, there is
        no implicit per-sample-update resolve. Instead, the application explicitly controls when the resolve operation is performed. The resolve operation is
        affected by calling BlitFramebufferEXT (provided by the EXT_framebuffer_blit extension) where the source is a multisample application-created
        framebuffer object and the destination is a single-sample framebuffer object (either application-created or window-system provided).

        This design for multisample resolve more closely matches current hardware, but still permits implementations which choose to resolve a single sample at
        a time. If hardware that implementes the multisample resolution "one sample at a time" exposes EXT_framebuffer_multisample, it could perform the
        implicit resolve to a driver-managed hidden surface, then read from that surface when the application calls BlitFramebufferEXT.

        Another motivation for granting the application explicit control over the multisample resolve operation has to do with the flexibility afforded by
        EXT_framebuffer_object. Previously, a drawable (window or pbuffer) had exclusive access to all of its buffers. There was no mechanism for sharing a
        buffer across multiple drawables. Under EXT_framebuffer_object, however, a mechanism exists for sharing a framebuffer-attachable image across several
        framebuffer objects, as well as sharing an image between a framebuffer object and a texture. If we had retained the "implicit"
        resolve from traditional multisampled rendering, and allowed the creation of "multisample" format renderbuffers, then this type of sharing would have
        lead to two problematic situations:
        ${ul(
            "Two contexts, which shared renderbuffers, might perform competing resolve operations into the same single-sample buffer with ambiguous results.",
            "It would have introduced the unfortunate ability to use the single-sample buffer as a texture while MULTISAMPLE is ENABLED."
        )}
        By using the BlitFramebufferEXT from EXT_framebuffer_blit as an explicit resolve to serialize access to the multisampled contents and eliminate the
        implicit per-sample resolve operation, we avoid both of these problems.
