        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension allows creating OpenGL sync objects linked to OpenCL event objects, potentially improving efficiency of sharing images and buffers between
        the two APIs. The companion {@link org.lwjgl.opencl.KHRGLEvent cl_khr_gl_event} OpenCL extension provides the complementary functionality of creating an
        OpenCL event object from an OpenGL fence sync object.

        Requires ${GL32.core} or ${ARB_sync.link}. Requires an OpenCL implementation supporting sharing event objects with OpenGL.
