        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        Some OpenGL implementations support modes of multisampling which have
        properties which are non-obvious to applications and/or which may not be
        standards conformant. The idea of non-conformant AA modes is not new,
        and is exposed in both GLX and EGL with config caveats and the
        GLX_NON_CONFORMANT_CONFIG for GLX and EGL_NON_CONFORMANT_CONFIG for EGL,
        or by querying the EGL_CONFORMANT attribute in newer versions of EGL.

        Both of these mechanisms operate on a per-config basis, which works as
        intended for window-based configs. However, with the advent of
        application-created FBOs, it is now possible to do all the multisample
        operations in an application-created FBO and never use a multisample
        window.

        This extension further extends the internalformat query mechanism
        (first introduced by ARB_internalformat_query and extended in
        ARB_internalformat_query2) and introduces a mechanism for a
        implementation to report properties of formats that may also be
        dependent on the number of samples.  This includes information
        such as whether the combination of format and samples should be
        considered conformant. This enables an implementation to report
        caveats which might apply to both window and FBO-based rendering
        configurations.

        Requires ${GL42.core} or ${ARB_internalformat_query.link}.
