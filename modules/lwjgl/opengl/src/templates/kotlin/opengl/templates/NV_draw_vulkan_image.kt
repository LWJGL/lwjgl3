        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension provides a new function, #DrawVkImageNV(), allowing applications to draw a screen-aligned rectangle displaying some or all of the
        contents of a two-dimensional Vulkan VkImage. Callers specify a Vulkan {@code VkImage} handle, an optional OpenGL sampler object, window coordinates of
        the rectangle to draw, and texture coordinates corresponding to the corners of the rectangle. For each fragment produced by the rectangle,
        {@code DrawVkImageNV} interpolates the texture coordinates, performs a texture lookup, and uses the texture result as the fragment color.

        No shaders are used by {@code DrawVkImageNV}; the results of the texture lookup are used in lieu of a fragment shader output. The fragments generated
        are processed by all per-fragment operations. In particular, {@code DrawVkImageNV()} fully supports blending and multisampling.

        In order to synchronize between Vulkan and OpenGL there are three other functions provided; #WaitVkSemaphoreNV(), #SignalVkSemaphoreNV() and
        #SignalVkFenceNV(). These allow OpenGL to wait for Vulkan to complete work and also Vulkan to wait for OpenGL to complete work. Together OpenGL and
        Vulkan can synchronize on the server without application interation.

        Finally the function {@code GetVkProcAddrNV()} is provided to allow the OpenGL context to query the Vulkan entry points directly and avoid having to
        load them through the typical Vulkan loader.
