        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension extends the conservative rasterization funtionality provided by NV_conservative_raster. It provides a new control to generate an
        "over-conservative" rasterization by dilating primitives prior to rasterization.

        When using conservative raster to bin geometry, this extension provides a programmable overlap region between adjacent primitives. Regular
        rasterization bins triangles with a shared edge uniquely into pixels. Conservative raster has a one-pixel overlap along the shared edge. Using a
        half-pixel raster dilation, this overlap region increases to two pixels.

        Requires ${NV_conservative_raster.link}.
