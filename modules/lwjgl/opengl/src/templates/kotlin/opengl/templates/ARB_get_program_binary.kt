        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension introduces new commands to retrieve and set the binary representation of a program object. #GetProgramBinary() allows an application to
        cache compiled and linked programs to avoid compiling and linking when used again. This may even allow the GL itself to act as an offline compiler. The
        resulting program binary can be reloaded into the GL via #ProgramBinary(). This is a very useful path for applications that wish to remain portable by
        shipping pure GLSL source shaders, yet would like to avoid the cost of compiling their shaders at runtime. Instead an application can supply its GLSL
        source shaders during first application run, or even during installation. The application then compiles and links its shaders and reads back the program
        binaries. On subsequent runs, only the program binaries need be supplied.

        #ProgramBinary() may also accept binaries in vendor-specific formats produced by specialized offline compilation tools. This extension does not add any
        such formats, but allows for them in further extensions. Though the level of optimization may not be identical -- the offline shader compiler may have
        the luxury of more aggressive optimization at its disposal -- program binaries generated online by the GL are interchangeable with those generated
        offline by an SDK tool.

        Requires ${GL30.core}. ${GL41.promoted}
