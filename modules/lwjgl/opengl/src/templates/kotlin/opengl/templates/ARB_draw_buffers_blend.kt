        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension builds upon the ${ARB_draw_buffers.link} and ${EXT_draw_buffers2.link} extensions. In ARB_draw_buffers (part of OpenGL 2.0), separate
        values could be written to each color buffer. This was further enhanced by EXT_draw_buffers2 by adding in the ability to enable blending and to set
        color write masks independently per color output.

        This extension provides the ability to set individual blend equations and blend functions for each color output.

        Requires ${GL20.core} and ${EXT_draw_buffers2.link}. ${GL40.promoted}
