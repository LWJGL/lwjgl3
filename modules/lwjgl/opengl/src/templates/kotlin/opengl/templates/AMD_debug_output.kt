        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension allows the GL to notify applications when various debug events occur in contexts that have been created with the debug flag, as provided
        by ${WGL_ARB_create_context.link} and ${GLX_ARB_create_context.link}.

        These events are represented in the form of enumerable messages with an included human-readable translation. Examples of debug events include incorrect
        use of the GL, warnings of undefined behavior, and performance warnings.
  
        A message is uniquely identified by a category and an implementation-dependent ID within that category. Message categories are general and are used to
        organize large groups of similar messages together. Examples of categories include GL errors, performance warnings, and deprecated functionality
        warnings. Each message is also assigned a severity level that denotes roughly how "important" that message is in comparison to other messages across all
        categories. For example, notification of a GL error would have a higher severity than a performance warning due to redundant state changes.
  
        Messages are communicated to the application through an application-defined callback function that is called by the GL implementation on each debug
        message. The motivation for the callback routine is to free application developers from actively having to query whether any GL error or other
        debuggable event has happened after each call to a GL function. With a callback, developers can keep their code free of debug checks, and only have to
        react to messages as they occur. In order to support indirect rendering, a message log is also provided that stores copies of recent messages until they
        are actively queried.

        To control the volume of debug output, messages can be disabled either individually by ID, or entire groups of messages can be turned off based on
        category or severity.
  
        The only requirement on the minimum quantity and type of messages that implementations of this extension must support is that a message must be sent
        notifying the application whenever any GL error occurs. Any further messages are left to the implementation. Implementations do not have to output
        messages from all categories listed by this extension in order to support this extension, and new categories can be added by other extensions.

        This extension places no restrictions or requirements on any additional functionality provided by the debug context flag through other extensions.
     
        Requires ${WGL_ARB_create_context.link} or ${GLX_ARB_create_context.link}.

        calling convention must be the same as the calling convention of GL functions. Anything else will result in undefined behavior. Only one debug callback
        can be specified for the current context, and further calls overwrite the previous callback. Specifying zero as the value of {@code callback} clears the
        current callback and disables message output through callbacks. Applications can specify user-specified data through the pointer {@code userParam}. The

        respectively. The string representation of the message is stored in {@code message} and its length (excluding the null-terminator) is stored in
        {@code length}. The parameter {@code userParam} is the user-specified value that was passed when calling DebugMessageCallbackAMD. The memory for

        responsibility to ensure that any work that occurs inside the debug callback function is thread-safe. Furthermore, calling any GL or window layer
        function from within the callback function results in undefined behavior.

        If no callback is set, then messages are instead stored in an internal message log up to some maximum number of strings as defined by the
        implementation-dependent constant #MAX_DEBUG_LOGGED_MESSAGES_AMD. Each context stores its own message log and will only store messages generated by
        commands operating in that context. If the message log is full, then the oldest messages will be removed from the log to make room for newer ones. The
