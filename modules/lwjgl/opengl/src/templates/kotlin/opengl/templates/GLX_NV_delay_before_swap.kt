        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        For most interactive applications, the standard rendering loop responding to input events on a frame granularity is sufficient. Some more demanding
        applications may want to exchange performance for the ability to sample input closer to the final frame swap and adjust rendering accordingly. This
        extension adds functionality to allow the application to wait until a specified time before a swapbuffers command would be able to execute.

        Requires ${GLX11.link} and ${GLX_EXT_swap_control.link}.

    Bool(
        "DelayBeforeSwapNV",
        """
        Blocks the CPU until {@code seconds} seconds before a synchronized swap would occur on a particular GLX window drawable. It also returns a boolean value
        equal to {@code True} when the implementation had to wait for the synchronized swap and {@code False} otherwise.

        The parameter {@code seconds} accepts positive floating point values not larger than the length in seconds of the swap period on the associated
        drawable. When buffer swaps are synchronized, the swap period is composed of one or multiple video frame periods. A video frame period is the time
        required by the monitor to display a full frame of video data. A swap interval set to a value of 2 means that the color buffers will be swapped at most
        every other video frame. If {@code seconds} is smaller than 0, {@code DelayBeforeSwapNV} will return False and will not wait for the end of the swap
        period. If {@code seconds} is greater than a swap period, {@code DelayBeforeSwapNV} will return immediately without generating any error and the return
        value will be False.

        The application should use a {@code seconds} delay large enough to have time to complete its work before the end of the swap period. If {@code seconds}
        is close to 0.0, the application may miss the end of the swap period and it will have to wait an additional swap period before it can swap.

        If {@code DelayBeforeSwapNV} detects that there is less than {@code seconds} seconds before the end of the swap period, it will return immediately and
        the return value will be False. The implementation will not wait an additional video frame period to have an exact delay of {@code seconds} seconds.

        If buffer swaps are unsynchronized, {@code DelayBeforeSwapNV} will return immediately and the return value will be False. It could happen for multiple
        reasons, for example if the swap interval is equal to 0, if the window is in a mode switch or if no monitors are active.
