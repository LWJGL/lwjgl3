        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        The ${ARB_draw_indirect.link} extension (included in OpenGL 4.0) introduced mechanisms whereby the parameters for a draw function may be provided in a
        structure contained in a buffer object rather than as parameters to the drawing procedure. This is known as an indirect draw and is exposed as two new
        functions, ARBDrawIndirect#glDrawArraysIndirect() and ARBDrawIndirect#glDrawElementsIndirect(). Each of these functions generates a single batch of
        primitives.

        This extension builds on this functionality by providing procedures to invoke multiple draws from a single procedure call. This allows large batches of
        drawing commands to be assembled in server memory (via a buffer object) which may then be dispatched through a single function call.

        Requires ${GL40.core} or ${ARB_draw_indirect.link}. ${GL43.promoted}
