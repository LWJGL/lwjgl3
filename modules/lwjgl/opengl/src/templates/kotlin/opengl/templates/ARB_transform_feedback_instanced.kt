        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        Multiple instances of geometry may be specified to the GL by calling functions such as #DrawArraysInstanced() and #DrawElementsInstanced().
        Further, the results of a transform feedback operation may be returned to the GL by calling #DrawTransformFeedback(), or
        #DrawTransformFeedbackStream(). However, it is not presently possible to draw multiple instances of data transform feedback without using a query
        and the resulting round trip from server to client.

        This extension adds functionality to draw multiple instances of the result of a transform feedback operation.

        Requires ${GL40.core} or ${ARB_transform_feedback2.link}. Requires ${GL31.core} or ${ARB_draw_instanced.link}. ${GL42.promoted}
