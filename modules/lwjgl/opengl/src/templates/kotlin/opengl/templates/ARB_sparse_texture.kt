        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        Recent advances in application complexity and a desire for higher resolutions have pushed texture sizes up considerably. Often, the amount of physical
        memory available to a graphics processor is a limiting factor in the performance of texture-heavy applications. Once the available physical memory is
        exhausted, paging may occur bringing performance down considerably - or worse, the application may fail. Nevertheless, the amount of address space
        available to the graphics processor has increased to the point where many gigabytes - or even terabytes of address space may be usable even though that
        amount of physical memory is not present.

        This extension allows the separation of the graphics processor's address space (reservation) from the requirement that all textures must be physically
        backed (commitment). This exposes a limited form of virtualization for textures. Use cases include sparse (or partially resident) textures, texture
        paging, on-demand and delayed loading of texture assets and application controlled level of detail.

        Makes individual pages of a sparse texture resident or non resident.

        If the value of {@code commit} is #TRUE, then the texture pages contained in the region defined by the values of {@code xoffset}, {@code yoffset},
        {@code zoffset}, {@code width}, {@code height} and {@code depth} are committed. If they were not committed before the call, then new physical backing
        store is allocated and associated with the sparse pages and their initial content is undefined. If the pages were already committed, then they remain
        committed, no error is generated, and the content of those pages remains unmodified. If the value of {@code committed} is #FALSE, then the texture
        pages contained in the region are made de-committed. Their physical store is de-allocated, and their contents again become undefined.

        For the purposes of commitment, a cube map texture is treated as a 2D array texture with a depth of six and cube map array textures are treated as 2D
        array textures with a depth equal to six times the number of layers in the cube map array.

        For levels of a sparse texture where each dimension is a multiple of the virtual page size, the residency of individual page-size regions is controlled
        by TexPageCommitmentARB and such levels may be partially populated. When the mipmap chain reaches a level that is not an integer multiple of the virtual
        page size in any dimension, padding and memory layout considerations may make it impossible to treat that level and subsequent smaller ones as partially
        populated. The set of levels that can be partially populated is implementation-dependent. The total number of levels that may be partially populated may
        be queried by calling #GetTexParameteriv() with the {@code pname} #NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB.

        The collection of texture levels that may not be partially populated, if any, consists of levels #NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB and higher, and is referred to
        as the mipmap 'tail'. The levels comprising the tail are made resident or non-resident as a unit. The tail is resident if and only if
        TexPageCommitmentARB has been called successfully with {@code level} greater than or equal to #NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB and the value of {@code commit} was
        #TRUE for the last such call.

        Views of sparse textures are also considered sparse. Modifications to commitment of a texture via a view of it affect the parent texture and any other
        views containing the modified pages. If a view of a sparse texture references its tail (or is entirely contained within it), modifications to commitment
        of the tail via the view will affect the entire tail of the parent, even for parts of the tail that are not referenced by the view. Furthermore,
        modifications to tail commitment may affect views referencing other parts of the tail.
