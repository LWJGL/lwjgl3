        There is a common optimization for hardware accelerated implementation of OpenGL which relies on an early depth test to be run before the fragment

        This optimization does not affect the final rendering, and is typically possible when the fragment does not change the depth programmatically. (i.e.: it
        does not write to the built-in gl_FragDepth output). There are, however a class of operations on the depth in the shader which could still be performed

        When true, the $registryLink extension is supported.

        This extension provides alternative conventions for the fragment coordinate XY location available for programmable fragment processing.

        The scope of this extension deals *only* with how the fragment coordinate XY location appears during programming fragment processing. Beyond the scope
        of this extension are coordinate conventions used for rasterization or transformation.

        In the case of the coordinate conventions for rasterization and transformation, some combination of the viewport, depth range, culling state, and
        projection matrix state can be reconfigured to adopt other arbitrary clip-space and window-space coordinate space conventions. Adopting other clip-space
        and window-space conventions involves adjusting existing OpenGL state. However it is non-trivial to massage an arbitrary fragment shader or program to
        adopt a different window-space coordinate system because such shaders are encoded in various textual representations.

        The dominant 2D and 3D rendering APIs make two basic choices of convention when locating fragments in window space. The two choices are:
        ${ol(
            "Is the origin nearest the lower-left- or upper-left-most pixel of the window?",
            "Is the (x,y) location of the pixel nearest the origin at (0,0) or (0.5,0.5)?"
        )}
        OpenGL assumes a lower-left origin for window coordinates and assumes pixel centers are located at half-pixel coordinates. This means the XY location
        (0.5,0.5) corresponds to the lower-left-most pixel in a window.

        Other window coordinate conventions exist for other rendering APIs. X11, GDI, and Direct3D version through DirectX 9 assume an upper-left window origin
        and locate pixel centers at integer XY values. By this alternative convention, the XY location (0,0) corresponds to the upper-left-most pixel in a window.

        Direct3D for DirectX 10 assumes an upper-left origin (as do prior DirectX versions) yet assumes half-pixel coordinates (unlike prior DirectX versions).
        By the DirectX 10 convention, the XY location (0.5,0.5) corresponds to the upper-left-most pixel in a window.

        Fragment shaders can directly access the location of a given processed fragment in window space. We call this location the "fragment coordinate".

        This extension provides a means for fragment shaders written in GLSL or OpenGL assembly extensions to specify alternative conventions for determining
        the fragment coordinate value accessed during programmable fragment processing.

        The motivation for this extension is to provide an easy, efficient means for fragment shaders accessing a fragment's window-space location to adopt the
        fragment coordinate convention for which the shader was originally written.

        In unextended OpenGL 4.5, applications may produce a large number of fragment shader invocations that perform loads and stores to memory using image
        uniforms, atomic counter uniforms, buffer variables, or pointers. The order in which loads and stores to common addresses are performed by different
        fragment shader invocations is largely undefined. For algorithms that use shader writes and touch the same pixels more than once, one or more of the
        following techniques may be required to ensure proper execution ordering:
        ${ul(
            "inserting Finish or WaitSync commands to drain the pipeline between different \"passes\" or \"layers\";",
            "using only atomic memory operations to write to shader memory (which may be relatively slow and limits how memory may be updated); or",
            "injecting spin loops into shaders to prevent multiple shader invocations from touching the same memory concurrently."
        )}
        This extension provides new GLSL built-in functions beginInvocationInterlockARB() and endInvocationInterlockARB() that delimit a critical section of
        fragment shader code. For pairs of shader invocations with "overlapping" coverage in a given pixel, the OpenGL implementation will guarantee that the
        critical section of the fragment shader will be executed for only one fragment at a time.

        There are four different interlock modes supported by this extension, which are identified by layout qualifiers. The qualifiers
        "pixel_interlock_ordered" and "pixel_interlock_unordered" provides mutual exclusion in the critical section for any pair of fragments corresponding to
        the same pixel. When using multisampling, the qualifiers "sample_interlock_ordered" and "sample_interlock_unordered" only provide mutual exclusion for
        pairs of fragments that both cover at least one common sample in the same pixel; these are recommended for performance if shaders use per-sample data
        structures.

        Additionally, when the "pixel_interlock_ordered" or "sample_interlock_ordered" layout qualifier is used, the interlock also guarantees that the
        critical section for multiple shader invocations with "overlapping" coverage will be executed in the order in which the primitives were processed by
        the GL. Such a guarantee is useful for applications like blending in the fragment shader, where an application requires that fragment values to be
        composited in the framebuffer in primitive order.

        This extension can be useful for algorithms that need to access per-pixel data structures via shader loads and stores. Such algorithms using this
        extension can access such data structures in the critical section without worrying about other invocations for the same pixel accessing the data
        structures concurrently. Additionally, the ordering guarantees are useful for cases where the API ordering of fragments is meaningful. For example,
        applications may be able to execute programmable blending operations in the fragment shader, where the destination buffer is read via image loads and
        the final value is written via image stores.

        This extension provides new built-in functions to compute the composite of a set of boolean conditions across a group of shader invocations. These
        composite results may be used to execute shaders more efficiently on a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) processor. The set of shader invocations
        across which boolean conditions are evaluated is implementation-dependent, and this extension provides no guarantee over how individual shader
        invocations are assigned to such sets. In particular, the set of shader invocations has no necessary relationship with the compute shader local work
        group -- a pair of shader invocations in a single compute shader work group may end up in different sets used by these built-ins.

        Compute shaders operate on an explicitly specified group of threads (a local work group), but many implementations of OpenGL 4.3 will even group
        non-compute shader invocations and execute them in a SIMD fashion. When executing code like
        ${codeBlock("""
if (condition) {
    result = do_fast_path();
} else {
    result = do_general_path();

        is true and leave the other invocations dormant. Once do_fast_path() returns, it might call do_general_path() for invocations where {@code condition} is
        false and leave the other invocations dormant. In this case, the shader executes *both* the fast and the general path and might be better off just using
        the general path for all invocations.

        This extension provides the ability to avoid divergent execution by evaluting a condition across an entire SIMD invocation group using code like:
        ${codeBlock("""
if (allInvocationsARB(condition)) {
    result = do_fast_path();
} else {
    result = do_general_path();

        The built-in function allInvocationsARB() will return the same value for all invocations in the group, so the group will either execute do_fast_path()
        or do_general_path(), but never both. For example, shader code might want to evaluate a complex function iteratively by starting with an approximation
        of the result and then refining the approximation. Some input values may require a small number of iterations to generate an accurate result
        (do_fast_path) while others require a larger number (do_general_path). In another example, shader code might want to evaluate a complex function
        (do_general_path) that can be greatly simplified when assuming a specific value for one of its inputs (do_fast_path).

        When true, the $registryLink extension is supported.

        This extension provides a single new component format for vertex arrays to read 4-component unsigned byte vertex attributes with a BGRA component
        ordering.

        OpenGL expects vertex arrays containing 4 unsigned bytes per element to be in the RGBA, STRQ, or XYZW order (reading components left-to-right in their
        lower address to higher address order). Essentially the order the components appear in memory is the order the components appear in the resulting
        vertex attribute vector.

        However Direct3D has color (diffuse and specular) vertex arrays containing 4 unsigned bytes per element that are in a BGRA order (again reading
        components left-to-right in their lower address to higher address order). Direct3D calls this "ARGB" reading the components in the opposite order
        (reading components left-to-right in their higher address to lower address order). This ordering is generalized in the DirectX 10 by the
        DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM format.

        For an OpenGL application to source color data from a vertex buffer formatted for Direct3D's color array format conventions, the application is forced
        to either:
        ${ol(
            "Rely on a vertex program or shader to swizzle the color components from the BGRA to conventional RGBA order.",
            "Re-order the color data components in the vertex buffer from Direct3D's native BGRA order to OpenGL's native RGBA order."
        )}
        Neither option is entirely satisfactory.

        Option 1 means vertex shaders have to be re-written to source colors differently. If the same vertex shader is used with vertex arrays configured to
        source the color as 4 floating-point color components, the swizzle for BGRA colors stored as 4 unsigned bytes is no longer appropriate. The shader's
        swizzling of colors becomes dependent on the type and number of color components. Ideally the vertex shader should be independent from the format and
        component ordering of the data it sources.

        Option 2 is expensive because vertex buffers may have to be reformatted prior to use. OpenGL treats the memory for vertex arrays (whether client-side
        memory or buffer objects) as essentially untyped memory and vertex arrays can be stored separately, interleaved, or even interwoven (where multiple
        arrays overlap with differing strides and formats).

        Rather than force a re-ordering of either vertex array components in memory or a vertex array format-dependent re-ordering of vertex shader inputs,
        OpenGL can simply provide a vertex array format that matches the Direct3D color component ordering.

        This approach mimics that of the EXT_bgra extension for pixel and texel formats except for vertex instead of image data.

        In unextended OpenGL 4.3, applications may produce a large number of fragment shader invocations that perform loads and stores to memory using image
        uniforms, atomic counter uniforms, buffer variables, or pointers. The order in which loads and stores to common addresses are performed by different
        fragment shader invocations is largely undefined. For algorithms that use shader writes and touch the same pixels more than once, one or more of the

            "injecting spin loops into shaders to prevent multiple shader invocations from touching the same memory concurrently."

        This extension provides new GLSL built-in functions beginInvocationInterlockNV() and endInvocationInterlockNV() that delimit a critical section of
        fragment shader code. For pairs of shader invocations with "overlapping" coverage in a given pixel, the OpenGL implementation will guarantee that the
        critical section of the fragment shader will be executed for only one fragment at a time.

        There are four different interlock modes supported by this extension, which are identified by layout qualifiers. The qualifiers
        "pixel_interlock_ordered" and "pixel_interlock_unordered" provides mutual exclusion in the critical section for any pair of fragments corresponding to
        the same pixel. When using multisampling, the qualifiers "sample_interlock_ordered" and "sample_interlock_unordered" only provide mutual exclusion for
        pairs of fragments that both cover at least one common sample in the same pixel; these are recommended for performance if shaders use per-sample data
        structures.

        Additionally, when the "pixel_interlock_ordered" or "sample_interlock_ordered" layout qualifier is used, the interlock also guarantees that the
        critical section for multiple shader invocations with "overlapping" coverage will be executed in the order in which the primitives were processed by
        the GL. Such a guarantee is useful for applications like blending in the fragment shader, where an application requires that fragment values to be
        composited in the framebuffer in primitive order.

        This extension can be useful for algorithms that need to access per-pixel data structures via shader loads and stores. Such algorithms using this
        extension can access such data structures in the critical section without worrying about other invocations for the same pixel accessing the data
        structures concurrently. Additionally, the ordering guarantees are useful for cases where the API ordering of fragments is meaningful. For example,
        applications may be able to execute programmable blending operations in the fragment shader, where the destination buffer is read via image loads and
        the final value is written via image stores.

        change, view-dependent outputs like reflection vectors and similar are allowed.

        Modern GPUs allow contexts to render to almost any combination of supported color and auxiliary buffer formats. Traditionally GLX context creation is
        done with respect to a GLXFBConfig specifying buffer formats, and constrains contexts to only work with drawables created with a "compatible" config.

        This extension allows creation of GL & ES contexts without specifying a {@code GLXFBConfig}.
