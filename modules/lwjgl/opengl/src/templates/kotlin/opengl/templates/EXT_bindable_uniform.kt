        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension introduces the concept of bindable uniforms to the OpenGL Shading Language. A uniform variable can be declared bindable, which means that
        the storage for the uniform is not allocated by the compiler/linker anymore, but is backed by a buffer object. This buffer object is bound to the
        bindable uniform through the new command UniformBufferEXT(). Binding needs to happen after linking a program object.

        Binding different buffer objects to a bindable uniform allows an application to easily use different "uniform data sets", without having to re-specify
        the data every time.

        A buffer object can be bound to bindable uniforms in different program objects. If those bindable uniforms are all of the same type, accessing a
        bindable uniform in program object A will result in the same data if the same access is made in program object B. This provides a mechanism for
        'environment uniforms', uniform values that can be shared among multiple program objects.
