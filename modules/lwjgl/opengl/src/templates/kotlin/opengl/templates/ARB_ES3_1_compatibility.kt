        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension adds support for features of OpenGL ES 3.1 that are missing from OpenGL 4.4. Enabling these features will ease the process of porting
        applications from OpenGL ES 3.1 to OpenGL. Enabling these features will ease the process of porting applications from OpenGL ES 3.1 to OpenGL.

            "support for GLSL ES version 310.",
