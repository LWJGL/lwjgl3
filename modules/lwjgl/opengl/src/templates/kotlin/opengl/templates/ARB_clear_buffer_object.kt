        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        Buffer objects are fundamental to the operation of OpenGL. Buffers are used as a source of data for vertices and indices, read through buffer textures
        in shaders, used to transfer texture and image data into and out of textures and framebuffers, and may be written to by operations such as transform
        feedback. OpenGL contains mechanisms to copy sections of buffers from one to another, but it has no mechanism to initialize the content of a buffer to a
        known value. In effect, it has {@code memcpy}, but not {@code memset}.

        This extension adds such a mechanism and has several use cases. Examples include clearing a pixel unpack buffer before transferring data to a texture or
        resetting buffer data to a known value before sparse updates through shader image stores or transform feedback.

        Requires ${GL15.core}. ${GL43.promoted}
