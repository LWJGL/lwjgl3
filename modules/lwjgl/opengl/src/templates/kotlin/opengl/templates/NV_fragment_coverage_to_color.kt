        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension allows the fragment coverage value, represented as an
    integer bitfield, to be substituted for a color output being written to a
    single-component color buffer with integer components (e.g., R8UI).  The
    capability provided by this extension is different from simply writing the
    gl_SampleMask fragment shader output in that the coverage value written to
    the framebuffer is taken after alpha test, stencil test, and depth test,
    as well as after the multisample fragment operations such as
    alpha-to-coverage.
