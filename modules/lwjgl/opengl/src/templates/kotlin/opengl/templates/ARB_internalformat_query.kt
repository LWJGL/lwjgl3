        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        OpenGL 4.1 has a number of queries to indicate the maximum number of samples available for different formats. These give a coarse-grained query
        mechanism e.g. an implementation can expose different sample counts for integer and floating-point formats, but not for different floating-point
        formats. There is also no convenient way for the user to determine the granularity of sample counts available, only the maximum.

        This extension adds a query mechanism that allows the user to determine which sample counts are available for a specific internal format.

        Requires ${GL30.core} or ${ARB_framebuffer_object.link}. ${GL42.promoted}
