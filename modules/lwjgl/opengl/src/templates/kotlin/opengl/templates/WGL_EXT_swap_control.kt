        Specifies the minimum number of video frame periods per buffer swap for the window associated with the current context. The interval takes effect when
        org.lwjgl.system.windows.GDI32#SwapBuffers() or wglSwapLayerBuffer is first called subsequent to the {@code wglSwapIntervalEXT} call.

        A video frame period is the time required by the monitor to display a full frame of video data.  In the case of an interlaced monitor, this is typically
        the time required to display both the even and odd fields of a frame of video data.  An interval set to a value of 2 means that the color buffers will
        be swapped at most every other video frame.

        If {@code interval} is set to a value of 0, buffer swaps are not synchronized to a video frame.  The {@code interval} value is silently clamped to the
        maximum implementation-dependent value supported before being stored.

        The swap interval is not part of the render context state. It cannot be pushed or popped. The default swap interval is 1.
