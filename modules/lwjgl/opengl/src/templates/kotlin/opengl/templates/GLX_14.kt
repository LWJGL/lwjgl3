        Returns the address of the extension function named by {@code procName}. The pointer returned should be cast to a function pointer type matching the
        extension function's definition in that extension specification. A return value of #NULL indicates that the specified function does not exist for the
        implementation.

        A non-#NULL return value for {@code glXGetProcAddress} does not guarantee that an extension function is actually supported at runtime. The client must
        also query #GetString()(GL11#GL_EXTENSIONS) or #QueryExtensionsString() to determine if an extension is supported by a particular context.

        GL function pointers returned by {@code glXGetProcAddress} are independent of the currently bound context and may be used by any context which supports
        the extension.

        {@code glXGetProcAddress} may be queried for all of the following functions:
        ${ul(
            "All GL and GLX extension functions supported by the implementation (whether those extensions are supported by the current context or not).",
