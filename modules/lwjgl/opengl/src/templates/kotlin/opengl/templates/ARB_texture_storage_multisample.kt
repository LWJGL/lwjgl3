        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        The ${ARB_texture_storage.link} extension and OpenGL 4.2 introduced the concept of immutable texture objects. With these objects, once their data store
        has been sized and allocated, it could not be resized for the lifetime of the objects (although its content could be updated). OpenGL implementations
        may be able to take advantage of the knowledge that the underlying data store of certain objects cannot be deleted or otherwise reallocated without
        destruction of the whole object (normally, a much heavier weight and less frequent operation). Immutable storage for all types of textures besides
        multisample and buffer textures was introduced by ARB_texture_storage. For completeness, this extension introduces immutable storage for multisampled
        textures.

        Requires ${GL42.core} or ${ARB_texture_storage.link}. ${GL43.promoted}
