        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension defines pixel buffers (pbuffer for short). Pbuffers are additional non-visible rendering buffers for an OpenGL renderer. Pbuffers are
        equivalent to a window that has the same pixel format descriptor with the following exceptions:
        ${ol(
            "There is no rendering to a pbuffer by GDI.",
            "The pixel format descriptors used for a pbuffer can only be those that are supported by the ICD.  Generic formats are not valid.",
            "The allocation of a pbuffer can fail if there are insufficient resources (i.e., all the pbuffer memory has been allocated).",
            """
        The pixel buffer might be lost if a display mode change occurs. A query is provided that can be called after a display mode change to determine the
        state of the pixel buffer.
        """
        )}
        The intent of the pbuffer semantics is to enable implementations to allocate pbuffers in non-visible frame buffer memory. These pbuffers are intended to
        be "static" resources in that a program will typically allocate them only once rather than as a part of its rendering loop.  (Pbuffers should be
        deallocated when the program is no longer using them -- for example, if the program is iconified.)

        The frame buffer resources that are associated with a pbuffer are also static and are deallocated when the pbuffer is destroyed or possibly when a
        display mode change occurs.
