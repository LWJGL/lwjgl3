        Locks a CGL rendering context.

        The function CGLLockContext blocks the thread it is on until all other threads have unlocked the same context using the function
        #UnlockContext(). You can use CGLLockContext recursively. Context-specific CGL calls by themselves do not require locking, but you can
        guarantee serial processing for a group of calls by surrounding them with CGLLockContext and CGLUnlockContext. Keep in mind that calls from the OpenGL
        API (the API provided by the Architecture Review Board) require locking.

        Applications that use NSOpenGL classes with multithreading can lock contexts using the functions CGLLockContext and CGLUnlockContext. To perform
        rendering in a thread other than the main one, you can lock the context that you want to access and safely execute OpenGL commands. The locking calls
        must be placed around all OpenGL calls in all threads.
