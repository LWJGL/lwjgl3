/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_compute_shader.txt">ARB_compute_shader</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>Recent graphics hardware has become extremely powerful and a strong desire to harness this power for work (both graphics and non-graphics) that does not
 * fit the traditional graphics pipeline well has emerged. To address this, this extension adds a new single-stage program type known as a compute program.
 * This program may contain one or more compute shaders which may be launched in a manner that is essentially stateless. This allows arbitrary workloads to
 * be sent to the graphics hardware with minimal disturbance to the GL state machine.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In most respects, a compute program is identical to a traditional OpenGL program object, with similar status, uniforms, and other such properties. It
 * has access to many of the same resources as fragment and other shader types, such as textures, image variables, atomic counters, and so on. However, it
 * has no predefined inputs nor any fixed-function outputs. It cannot be part of a pipeline and its visible side effects are through its actions on images
 * and atomic counters.</p>
 * 
 * <p>OpenCL is another solution for using graphics processors as generalized compute devices. This extension addresses a different need. For example, OpenCL
 * is designed to be usable on a wide range of devices ranging from CPUs, GPUs, and DSPs through to FPGAs. While one could implement GL on these types of
 * devices, the target here is clearly GPUs. Another difference is that OpenCL is more full featured and includes features such as multiple devices,
 * asynchronous queues and strict IEEE semantics for floating point operations. This extension follows the semantics of OpenGL - implicitly synchronous,
 * in-order operation with single-device, single queue logical architecture and somewhat more relaxed numerical precision requirements. Although not as
 * feature rich, this extension offers several advantages for applications that can tolerate the omission of these features. Compute shaders are written in
 * GLSL, for example and so code may be shared between compute and other shader types. Objects are created and owned by the same context as the rest of the
 * GL, and therefore no interoperability API is required and objects may be freely used by both compute and graphics simultaneously without acquire-release
 * semantics or object type translation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL42 OpenGL 4.2}. Promoted to core in {@link GL43 OpenGL 4.3}.</p>
