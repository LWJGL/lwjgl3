/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_bindless_texture.txt">ARB_bindless_texture</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows OpenGL applications to access texture objects in shaders without first binding each texture to one of a limited number of texture
 * image units. Using this extension, an application can query a 64-bit unsigned integer texture handle for each texture that it wants to access and then
 * use that handle directly in GLSL or assembly-based shaders. The ability to access textures without having to bind and/or re-bind them is similar to the
 * capability provided by the {@link NVShaderBufferLoad NV_shader_buffer_load} extension that allows shaders to access buffer objects without binding them. In both cases,
 * these extensions significantly reduce the amount of API and internal GL driver overhead needed to manage resource bindings.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension also provides similar capability for the image load, store, and atomic functionality provided by OpenGL 4.2 and the
 * {@link ARBShaderImageLoadStore ARB_shader_image_load_store} and {@link EXTShaderImageLoadStore EXT_shader_image_load_store} extensions, where a texture can be accessed without first binding it to an
 * image unit. An image handle can be extracted from a texture object using an API with a set of parameters similar to those for
 * {@link EXTShaderImageLoadStore#glBindImageTextureEXT BindImageTextureEXT}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds no new data types to GLSL. Instead, it uses existing sampler and image data types and allows them to be populated with texture and
 * image handles. This extension does permit sampler and image data types to be used in more contexts than in unextended GLSL 4.00. In particular, sampler
 * and image types may be used as shader inputs/outputs, temporary variables, and uniform block members, and may be assigned to by shader code.
 * Constructors are provided to convert unsigned integer values to and from sampler and image data types. Additionally, new APIs are provided to load
 * values for sampler and image uniforms with 64-bit handle inputs. The use of existing integer-based Uniform* APIs is still permitted, in which case the
 * integer specified will identify a texture image or image unit. For samplers and images with values specified as texture image or image units, the GL
 * implemenation will translate the unit number to an internal handle as required.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To access texture or image resources using handles, the handles must first be made resident. Accessing a texture or image by handle without first
 * making it resident can result in undefined results, including program termination. Since the amount of texture memory required by an application may
 * exceed the amount of memory available to the system, this extension provides API calls allowing applications to manage overall texture memory
 * consumption by making a texture resident and non-resident as required.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL40 OpenGL 4.0}.</p>
