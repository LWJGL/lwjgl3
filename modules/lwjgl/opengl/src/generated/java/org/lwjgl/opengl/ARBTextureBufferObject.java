/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_texture_buffer_object.txt">ARB_texture_buffer_object</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension provides a new texture type, called a buffer texture. Buffer textures are one-dimensional arrays of texels whose storage comes from an
 * attached buffer object. When a buffer object is bound to a buffer texture, a format is specified, and the data in the buffer object is treated as an
 * array of texels of the specified format.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The use of a buffer object to provide storage allows the texture data to be specified in a number of different ways: via buffer object loads
 * ({@link GL15C#glBufferData BufferData}), direct CPU writes ({@link GL15C#glMapBuffer MapBuffer}), framebuffer readbacks (EXT_pixel_buffer_object extension). A buffer object can also be loaded
 * by transform feedback (NV_transform_feedback extension), which captures selected transformed attributes of vertices processed by the GL. Several of
 * these mechanisms do not require an extra data copy, which would be required when using conventional TexImage-like entry points.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Buffer textures do not support mipmapping, texture lookups with normalized floating-point texture coordinates, and texture filtering of any sort, and
 * may not be used in fixed-function fragment processing. They can be accessed via single texel fetch operations in programmable shaders. For assembly
 * shaders (NV_gpu_program4), the TXF instruction is used. For GLSL (EXT_gpu_shader4), a new sampler type and texel fetch function are used.</p>
 * 
 * <p>While buffer textures can be substantially larger than equivalent one-dimensional textures; the maximum texture size supported for buffer textures in
 * the initial implementation of this extension is 2^27 texels, versus 2^13 (8192) texels for otherwise equivalent one-dimensional textures. When a buffer
 * object is attached to a buffer texture, a size is not specified; rather, the number of texels in the texture is taken by dividing the size of the buffer
 * object by the size of each texel.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL20 OpenGL 2.0} and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_gpu_program4.txt">NV_gpu_program4</a> or {@link EXTGPUShader4 EXT_gpu_shader4}. Promoted to core in {@link GL31 OpenGL 3.1}.</p>

     * of the GL data type corresponding to {@code internalformat}. Each texel consists of one to four elements that are mapped to texture components
     * (R, G, B, A, L, and I). Element {@code m} of the texel numbered {@code n} is taken from element {@code n} * {@code components} + {@code m} of the
