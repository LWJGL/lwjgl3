/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/AMD/AMD_stencil_operation_extended.txt">AMD_stencil_operation_extended</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>Stencil buffers are special buffers that allow tests to be made against an incoming value and action taken based on that value. The stencil buffer is
 * updated during rasterization, and the operation used to update the stencil buffer is chosen based on whether the fragment passes the stencil test, and
 * if it does, whether it passes the depth test. Traditional OpenGL includes support for several primitive operations, such as incrementing, or clearing
 * the content of the stencil buffer, or replacing it with a specified reference value.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds support for an additional set of operations that may be performed on the stencil buffer under each circumstance. Additionally, this
 * extension separates the value used as the source for stencil operations from the reference value, allowing different values to be used in the stencil
 * test, and in the update of the stencil buffer.</p>
