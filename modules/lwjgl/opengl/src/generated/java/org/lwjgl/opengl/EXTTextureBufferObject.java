/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_texture_buffer_object.txt">EXT_texture_buffer_object</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension provides a new texture type, called a buffer texture. Buffer textures are one-dimensional arrays of texels whose storage comes from an
 * attached buffer object. When a buffer object is bound to a buffer texture, a format is specified, and the data in the buffer object is treated as an
 * array of texels of the specified format.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The use of a buffer object to provide storage allows the texture data to be specified in a number of different ways: via buffer object loads
 * (BufferData), direct CPU writes (MapBuffer), framebuffer readbacks (EXT_pixel_buffer_object extension). A buffer object can also be loaded by transform
 * feedback (NV_transform_feedback extension), which captures selected transformed attributes of vertices processed by the GL. Several of these mechanisms
 * do not require an extra data copy, which would be required when using conventional TexImage-like entry points.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Buffer textures do not support mipmapping, texture lookups with normalized floating-point texture coordinates, and texture filtering of any sort, and
 * may not be used in fixed-function fragment processing. They can be accessed via single texel fetch operations in programmable shaders. For assembly
 * shaders (NV_gpu_program4), the TXF instruction is used. For GLSL (EXT_gpu_shader4), a new sampler type and texel fetch function are used.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Buffer textures can be substantially larger than equivalent one-dimensional textures; the maximum texture size supported for buffer textures in the
 * initial implementation of this extension is 2^27 texels, versus 2^13 (8192) texels for otherwise equivalent one-dimensional textures. (Note that this
 * extension only guarantees support for buffer textures with 2^16 texels, but we expect most implementations to exceed that substantially.) When a buffer
 * object is attached to a buffer texture, a size is not specified; rather, the number of texels in the texture is taken by dividing the size of the
 * buffer object by the size of each texel.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL20 OpenGL 2.0} and {@link EXTGPUShader4 EXT_gpu_shader4} or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_gpu_program4.txt">NV_gpu_program4</a>.</p>
