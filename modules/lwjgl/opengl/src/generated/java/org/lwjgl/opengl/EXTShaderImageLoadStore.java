/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_shader_image_load_store.txt">EXT_shader_image_load_store</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension provides GLSL built-in functions allowing shaders to load from, store to, and perform atomic read-modify-write operations to a single
 * level of a texture object from any shader stage. These built-in functions are named imageLoad(), imageStore(), and imageAtomic*(), respectively, and
 * accept integer texel coordinates to identify the texel accessed. The extension adds the notion of "image units" to the OpenGL API, to which texture
 * levels are bound for access by the GLSL built-in functions. To allow shaders to specify the image unit to access, GLSL provides a new set of data types
 * ("image*") similar to samplers. Each image variable is assigned an integer value to identify an image unit to access, which is specified using
 * Uniform*() APIs in a manner similar to samplers. For implementations supporting the NV_gpu_program5 extensions, assembly language instructions to
 * perform image loads, stores, and atomics are also provided.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension also provides the capability to explicitly enable "early" per-fragment tests, where operations like depth and stencil testing are
 * performed prior to fragment shader execution. In unextended OpenGL, fragment shaders never have any side effects and implementations can sometimes
 * perform per-fragment tests and discard some fragments prior to executing the fragment shader. Since this extension allows fragment shaders to write to
 * texture and buffer object memory using the built-in image functions, such optimizations could lead to non-deterministic results. To avoid this,
 * implementations supporting this extension may not perform such optimizations on shaders having such side effects. However, enabling early per-fragment
 * tests guarantees that such tests will be performed prior to fragment shader execution, and ensures that image stores and atomics will not be performed
 * by fragment shader invocations where these per-fragment tests fail.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Finally, this extension provides both a GLSL built-in function and an OpenGL API function allowing applications some control over the ordering of image
 * loads, stores, and atomics relative to other OpenGL pipeline operations accessing the same memory. Because the extension provides the ability to
 * perform random accesses to texture or buffer object memory, such accesses are not easily tracked by the OpenGL driver. To avoid the need for
 * heavy-handed synchronization at the driver level, this extension requires manual synchronization. The MemoryBarrierEXT() OpenGL API function allows
 * applications to specify a bitfield indicating the set of OpenGL API operations to synchronize relative to shader memory access. The memoryBarrier()
 * GLSL built-in function provides a synchronization point within a given shader invocation to ensure that all memory accesses performed prior to the
 * synchronization point complete prior to any started after the synchronization point.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL30 OpenGL 3.0}.</p>
