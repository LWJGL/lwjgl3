/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_buffer_storage.txt">ARB_buffer_storage</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>OpenGL has long supported buffer objects as a means of storing data that may be used to source vertex attributes, pixel data for textures, uniforms and
 * other elements. In un-extended GL, buffer data stores are mutable - that is, they may be de-allocated or resized while they are in use. The
 * {@link ARBTextureStorage ARB_texture_storage} extension added immutable storage for texture object (and was subsequently incorporated into OpenGL 4.2). This extension
 * further applies the concept of immutable storage to buffer objects. If an implementation is aware of a buffer's immutability, it may be able to make
 * certain assumptions or apply particular optimizations in order to increase performance or reliability.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Furthermore, this extension allows applications to pass additional information about a requested allocation to the implementation which it may use to
 * select memory heaps, caching behavior or allocation strategies.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Finally, this extension introduces the concept of persistent client mappings of buffer objects, which allow clients to retain pointers to a buffer's
 * data store returned as the result of a mapping, and to issue drawing commands while those mappings are in place.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Promoted to core in {@link GL44 OpenGL 4.4}.</p>
