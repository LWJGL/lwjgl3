/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_raster_multisample.txt">EXT_raster_multisample</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows rendering to a non-multisample color buffer while rasterizing with more than one sample. The result of rasterization (coverage)
 * is available in the {@code gl_SampleMaskIn[]} fragment shader input, multisample rasterization is enabled for all primitives, and several per- fragment
 * operations operate at the raster sample rate.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When using the functionality provided by this extension, depth, stencil, and depth bounds tests must be disabled, and a multisample draw framebuffer
 * must not be used.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A fragment's "coverage", or "effective raster samples" is considered to have "N bits" (as opposed to "one bit" corresponding to the single color
 * sample) through the fragment shader, in the sample mask output, through the multisample fragment operations and occlusion query, until the coverage is
 * finally "reduced" to a single bit in a new "Coverage Reduction" stage that occurs before blending.</p>
