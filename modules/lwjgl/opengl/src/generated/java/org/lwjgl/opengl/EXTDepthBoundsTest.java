/**
 * Native bindings to the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_depth_bounds_test.txt">EXT_depth_bounds_test</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds a new per-fragment test that is, logically, after the scissor test and before the alpha test. The depth bounds test compares the
 * depth value stored at the location given by the incoming fragment's (xw,yw) coordinates to a user-defined minimum and maximum depth value. If the stored
 * depth value is outside the user-defined range (exclusive), the incoming fragment is discarded.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Unlike the depth test, the depth bounds test has NO dependency on the fragment's window-space depth value.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This functionality is useful in the context of attenuated stenciled shadow volume rendering. To motivate the functionality's utility in this context, we
 * first describe how conventional scissor testing can be used to optimize shadow volume rendering.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If an attenuated light source's illumination can be bounded to a rectangle in XY window-space, the conventional scissor test can be used to discard
 * shadow volume fragments that are guaranteed to be outside the light source's window-space XY rectangle. The stencil increments and decrements that would
 * otherwise be generated by these scissored fragments are inconsequential because the light source's illumination can pre-determined to be fully
 * attenuated outside the scissored region. In other words, the scissor test can be used to discard shadow volume fragments rendered outside the scissor,
 * thereby improving performance, without affecting the ultimate illumination of these pixels with respect to the attenuated light source.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This scissoring optimization can be used both when rendering the stenciled shadow volumes to update stencil (incrementing and decrementing the stencil
 * buffer) AND when adding the illumination contribution of attenuated light source's.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In a similar fashion, we can compute the attenuated light source's window-space Z bounds (zmin,zmax) of consequential illumination. Unless a depth value
 * (in the depth buffer) at a pixel is within the range [zmin,zmax], the light source's illumination can be pre-determined to be inconsequential for the
 * pixel. Said another way, the pixel being illuminated is either far enough in front of or behind the attenuated light source so that the light source's
 * illumination for the pixel is fully attenuated. The depth bounds test can perform this test.</p>
