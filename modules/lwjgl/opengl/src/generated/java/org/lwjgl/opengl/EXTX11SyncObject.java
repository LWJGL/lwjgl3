/**

 * 
 * <p>Synchronization objects added the ability to better coordinate operations between multiple GL command streams. However, it is desirable to have the
 * same level of coordination between GL command streams and external rendering APIs. This extension introduces two new concepts to build upon the
 * synchronization infrastructure provided by {@link ARBSync ARB_sync}:</p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>A means to import an X Synchronization Fence object into the GL and use it as a sync object.</li>
 * <li>The concept of a reusable sync object.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>The latter is necessary because the import operation is expensive and performing it every time a synchronization point was reached would make the
 * synchronization prohibitively slow.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension stops short of allowing the GL to change the state of imported/reusable sync objects, but does not add any language that would prohibit
 * such functionality from being added in a subsequent extension.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL32 OpenGL 3.2} or {@link ARBSync ARB_sync}.</p>
