/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_sparse_texture.txt">ARB_sparse_texture</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>Recent advances in application complexity and a desire for higher resolutions have pushed texture sizes up considerably. Often, the amount of physical
 * memory available to a graphics processor is a limiting factor in the performance of texture-heavy applications. Once the available physical memory is
 * exhausted, paging may occur bringing performance down considerably - or worse, the application may fail. Nevertheless, the amount of address space
 * available to the graphics processor has increased to the point where many gigabytes - or even terabytes of address space may be usable even though that
 * amount of physical memory is not present.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension allows the separation of the graphics processor's address space (reservation) from the requirement that all textures must be physically
 * backed (commitment). This exposes a limited form of virtualization for textures. Use cases include sparse (or partially resident) textures, texture
 * paging, on-demand and delayed loading of texture assets and application controlled level of detail.</p>

    /**
     * Makes individual pages of a sparse texture resident or non resident.
     * 
     * <p>If the value of {@code commit} is {@link GL11#GL_TRUE TRUE}, then the texture pages contained in the region defined by the values of {@code xoffset}, {@code yoffset},
     * {@code zoffset}, {@code width}, {@code height} and {@code depth} are committed. If they were not committed before the call, then new physical backing
     * store is allocated and associated with the sparse pages and their initial content is undefined. If the pages were already committed, then they remain
     * committed, no error is generated, and the content of those pages remains unmodified. If the value of {@code committed} is {@link GL11#GL_FALSE FALSE}, then the texture
     * pages contained in the region are made de-committed. Their physical store is de-allocated, and their contents again become undefined.</p>
     * 
     * <p>For the purposes of commitment, a cube map texture is treated as a 2D array texture with a depth of six and cube map array textures are treated as 2D
     * array textures with a depth equal to six times the number of layers in the cube map array.</p>
     * 
     * <p>For levels of a sparse texture where each dimension is a multiple of the virtual page size, the residency of individual page-size regions is controlled
     * by TexPageCommitmentARB and such levels may be partially populated. When the mipmap chain reaches a level that is not an integer multiple of the virtual
     * page size in any dimension, padding and memory layout considerations may make it impossible to treat that level and subsequent smaller ones as partially
     * populated. The set of levels that can be partially populated is implementation-dependent. The total number of levels that may be partially populated may
     * be queried by calling {@link GL11C#glGetTexParameteriv GetTexParameteriv} with the {@code pname} {@link #GL_NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>The collection of texture levels that may not be partially populated, if any, consists of levels {@link #GL_NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB} and higher, and is referred to
     * as the mipmap 'tail'. The levels comprising the tail are made resident or non-resident as a unit. The tail is resident if and only if
     * TexPageCommitmentARB has been called successfully with {@code level} greater than or equal to {@link #GL_NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB NUM_SPARSE_LEVELS_ARB} and the value of {@code commit} was
     * {@link GL11#GL_TRUE TRUE} for the last such call.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Views of sparse textures are also considered sparse. Modifications to commitment of a texture via a view of it affect the parent texture and any other
     * views containing the modified pages. If a view of a sparse texture references its tail (or is entirely contained within it), modifications to commitment
     * of the tail via the view will affect the entire tail of the parent, even for parts of the tail that are not referenced by the view. Furthermore,
     * modifications to tail commitment may affect views referencing other parts of the tail.</p>
