/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_multisample.txt">ARB_multisample</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>This extension provides a mechanism to antialias all GL primitives: points, lines, polygons, bitmaps, and images. The technique is to sample all
 * primitives multiple times at each pixel. The color sample values are resolved to a single, displayable color each time a pixel is updated, so the
 * antialiasing appears to be automatic at the application level. Because each sample includes depth and stencil information, the depth and stencil
 * functions perform equivalently to the single-sample mode.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An additional buffer, called the multisample buffer, is added to the framebuffer. Pixel sample values, including color, depth, and stencil values, are
 * stored in this buffer. When the framebuffer includes a multisample buffer, it does not also include separate depth or stencil buffers, even if the
 * multisample buffer does not store depth or stencil values. Color buffers (left/right, front/back, and aux) do coexist with the multisample buffer,
 * however.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Multisample antialiasing is most valuable for rendering polygons, because it requires no sorting for hidden surface elimination, and it correctly
 * handles adjacent polygons, object silhouettes, and even intersecting polygons. If only points or lines are being rendered, the "smooth" antialiasing
 * mechanism provided by the base GL may result in a higher quality image. This extension is designed to allow multisample and smooth antialiasing
 * techniques to be alternated during the rendering of a single scene.</p>
