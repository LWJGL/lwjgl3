/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_pixel_data_range.txt">NV_pixel_data_range</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>The vertex array range extension is intended to improve the efficiency of OpenGL vertex arrays. OpenGL vertex arrays' coherency model and ability to
 * access memory from arbitrary locations in memory prevented implementations from using DMA (Direct Memory Access) operations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Many image-intensive applications, such as those that use dynamically generated textures, face similar problems. These applications would like to be
 * able to sustain throughputs of hundreds of millions of pixels per second through DrawPixels and hundreds of millions of texels per second through
 * TexSubImage.</p>
 * 
 * <p>However, the same restrictions that limited vertex throughput also limit pixel throughput.</p>
 * 
 * <p>By the time that any pixel operation that reads data from user memory returns, OpenGL requires that it must be safe for the application to start using
 * that memory for a different purpose. This coherency model prevents asynchronous DMA transfers directly out of the user's buffer.</p>
 * 
 * <p>There are also no restrictions on the pointer provided to pixel operations or on the size of the data. To facilitate DMA implementations, the driver
 * needs to know in advance what region of the address space to lock down.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Vertex arrays faced both of these restrictions already, but pixel operations have one additional complicating factor -- they are bidirectional. Vertex
 * array data is always being transfered from the application to the driver and the HW, whereas pixel operations sometimes transfer data to the
 * application from the driver and HW. Note that the types of memory that are suitable for DMA for reading and writing purposes are often different. For
 * example, on many PC platforms, DMA pulling is best accomplished with write-combined (uncached) AGP memory, while pushing data should use cached memory
 * so that the application can read the data efficiently once it has been read back over the AGP bus.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension defines an API where an application can specify two pixel data ranges, which are analogous to vertex array ranges, except that one is
 * for operations where the application is reading data (e.g. glReadPixels) and one is for operations where the application is writing data (e.g.
 * glDrawPixels, glTexSubImage2D, etc.). Each pixel data range has a pointer to its start and a length in bytes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When the pixel data range is enabled, and if the pointer specified as the argument to a pixel operation is inside the corresponding pixel data range,
 * the implementation may choose to asynchronously pull data from the pixel data range or push data to the pixel data range. Data pulled from outside the
 * pixel data range is undefined, while pushing data to outside the pixel data range produces undefined results.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The application may synchronize with the hardware in one of two ways: by flushing the pixel data range (or causing an implicit flush) or by using the
 * NV_fence extension to insert fences in the command stream.</p>
