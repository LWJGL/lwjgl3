/**
 * Native bindings to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_sample_shading.txt">ARB_sample_shading</a> extension.
 * 
 * <p>In standard multisample rendering, an implementation is allowed to assign the same color and texture coordinate values to each sample, which then allows
 * the optimization where the shader is only evaluated once and then distributed to the samples that have been determined to be covered by the primitive
 * currently being rasterized. This can cause aliasing where the input color and texture coordinates are used to generate a result that doesn't antialias
 * itself, for example with alpha-tested transparency.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds the ability to explicitly request that an implementation use a minimum number of unique set of fragment computation inputs when
 * multisampling a pixel. Specifying such a requirement can reduce aliasing that results from evaluating the fragment computations too few times per pixel.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This extension adds new global state that controls the minimum number of samples for which attribute data is independently interpolated. When enabled,
 * all operations that were traditionally executed per-fragment operate independently on each sample.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This also extends the shading language to allow control over the sample being processed. This includes built-in fragment input variables identifying the
 * sample number and position being processed when executing fragment shaders per sample.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Requires {@link GL20 OpenGL 2.0} and GLSL 1.30. Promoted to core in {@link GL30 OpenGL 3.0}.</p>
