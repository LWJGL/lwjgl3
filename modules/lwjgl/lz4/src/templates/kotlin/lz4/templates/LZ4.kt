        Native bindings to ${url("http://lz4.github.io/lz4/", "LZ4")}, a lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core,
        scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on
        multi-core systems.

        Speed can be tuned dynamically, selecting an "acceleration" factor which trades compression ratio for more speed up. On the other end, a high
        compression derivative, {@code LZ4_HC}, is also provided, trading CPU time for improved compression ratio. All versions feature the same decompression
        speed.

        The raw LZ4 block compression format is detailed within <a href="https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Block_format.md">lz4_Block_format</a>.

        To compress an arbitrarily long file or data stream, multiple blocks are required. Organizing these blocks and providing a common header format to
        handle their content is the purpose of the Frame format, defined into
        <a href="https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Frame_format.md">lz4_Frame_format</a>. Interoperable versions of LZ4 must respect this frame
        format.
