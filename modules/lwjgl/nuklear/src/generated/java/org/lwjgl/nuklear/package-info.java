 * Bindings to the <a href="https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear">Nuklear</a> library.
 * 
 * <p>A minimal state immediate mode graphical user interface single header toolkit written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a
 * simple embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies, a default renderbackend or OS window and input handling but
 * instead provides a very modular library approach by using simple input state for input and draw commands describing primitive shapes as output. So
 * instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and render backends it only focuses on the actual UI.</p>
