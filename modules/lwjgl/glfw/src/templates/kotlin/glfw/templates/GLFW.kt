        Creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES context. Most of the options controlling how the window and its context should be created are
        specified with window hints.

        Successful creation does not change which context is current. Before you can use the newly created context, you need to make it current. For information
        about the {@code share} parameter, see ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/context.html\\#context_sharing", "context sharing")}.

        The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you requested, as not all parameters and hints are hard constraints. This includes the
        size of the window, especially for full screen windows. To query the actual attributes of the created window, framebuffer and context, use queries like
        #GetWindowAttrib() and #GetWindowSize() and #GetFramebufferSize().

        To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window will cover. If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
        Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is recommended that you pick the primary monitor. For more information on how to
        query connected monitors, see ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/monitor.html\\#monitor_monitors", "monitors")}.

        For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the window's <i>desired video mode</i>. As long as a full screen window is not
        iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video mode is set for the specified monitor. For more information about full
        screen windows, including the creation of so called <i>windowed full screen</i> or <i>borderless full screen</i> windows, see
        ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html\\#window_windowed_full_screen", "full screen")}.

        Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and full screen mode with #SetWindowMonitor(). If the window has an OpenGL or
        OpenGL ES context, it will be unaffected.

        By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the window system. To create the window at a specific position, make it initially
        invisible using the #VISIBLE window hint, set its ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html\\#window_pos", "position")} and then
        ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html\\#window_hide", "show")} it.

        As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver is prohibited from starting.

        Window systems put limits on window sizes. Very large or very small window dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation. Check the
        actual ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html\\#window_size", "size")} after creation.

        The ${url("http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html\\#buffer_swap", "swap interval")} is not set during window creation and the initial value may vary
        depending on driver settings and defaults.
