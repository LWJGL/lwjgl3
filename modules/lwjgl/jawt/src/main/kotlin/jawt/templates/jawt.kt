        Bindings to the AWT native interface (jawt.h).

        The AWT native interface allows a native C or C++ application a means by which to access native structures in AWT. This is to facilitate moving legacy
        C and C++ applications to Java and to target the needs of the community who, at present, wish to do their own native rendering to canvases for
        performance reasons. Standard extensions such as Java3D also require a means to access the underlying native data structures of AWT.

        <h3>AWT Native Drawing Surface (JAWT_DrawingSurface)</h3>

        For each platform, there is a native drawing surface structure. This platform-specific structure can be found in {@code jawt_md.h}. See
        ##JAWTX11DrawingSurfaceInfo for the Linux platform, ##JAWTWin32DrawingSurfaceInfo for the Windows platform and #MACOSX_USE_CALAYER for the OS X
        platform.
