 * <p>AMD Tootle (Triangle Order Optimization Tool) is a 3D triangle mesh optimization library that improves on existing mesh preprocessing techniques. By
 * using AMD Tootle, developers can optimize their models for pixel overdraw as well as vertex cache performance. This can provide significant performance
 * improvements in pixel limited situations, with no penalty in vertex-limited scenarios, and no runtime cost.</p>
