        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension introduces the concept of protected contexts and protected resources, specifically surfaces and {@code EGLImages}. Applications can
        choose at creation time whether a context, surface or {@code EGLImage} is protected or not.

        A protected context is required to allow the GPU to operate on protected resources, including protected surfaces and protected {@code EGLImages}.

        An explanation of undefined behavior in this extension: Several places in this extension mention undefined behavior can result, which can include
        program termination. The reason for this is because one way to handle protected content is by using a protected virtual to physical memory translation
        layer. With this sort of solution a system may generate read or write faults when a non-protected source tries to access a protected buffer. Depending
        on the system these faults might be ignored or they might cause process termination. This undefined behavior should not include actually allowing a
        transfer of data from a protected surface to a non-protected surface.

        Requires ${EGL14.core}.
