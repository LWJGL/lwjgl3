        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension provides a means to issue a swap buffers request to display the contents of the current back buffer and also specify a list of damage
        rectangles that can be passed to a system compositor so it can minimize how much it has to recompose.

        This should be used in situations where an application is only animating a small portion of a surface since it enables the compositor to avoid wasting
        time recomposing parts of the surface that haven't changed.

        Requires ${EGL14.core}.
