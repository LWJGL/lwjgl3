        When true, the $registryLink extension is supported.

        This extension introduces the concept of *extension type*, requires that each EGL extension belong to exactly one type, and defines two types: display
        and client. It also provides a method to query, without initializing a display, the set of supported client extensions.

        A display extension adds functionality to an individual EGLDisplay. This type of extension has always existed but, until EGL_EXT_client_extensions,
        lacked an identifying name.

        A client extension adds functionality that is independent of any display. In other words, it adds functionality to the EGL client library itself. This
        is a new type of extension defined by EGL_EXT_client_extensions. EGL_EXT_client_extensions is itself a client extension.

        We suggest that each future extension clearly state its type by including the following toplevel section in its extension specification, preceding the
        Dependencies section. For client extensions, this suggestion is a requirement.
        ${codeBlock("""
        Extension Type

            &lt;Either "EGL display extension" or "EGL client extension" or
             a future extension type.&gt;""")}

        By cleanly separating display extensions from client extensions, EGL_EXT_client_extensions solves a bootstrap problem for future EGL extensions that
        will modify display initialization. To query for such extensions without EGL_EXT_client_extensions, an EGL client would need to initialize a throw-away
        EGLDisplay solely to query its extension string. Initialization of the throw-away display may have undesired side-effects (discussed in the issues
        section below) for EGL clients that wish to use the new methods of display initialization.

        When true, the ${registryLink("KHR", "EGL_KHR_get_all_proc_addresses")} extension is supported.

        eglGetProcAddress is currently defined to not support the querying of non-extension EGL or client API functions. Non-extension functions are expected
        to be exposed as library symbols that can be resolved statically at link time, or dynamically at run time using OS-specific runtime linking mechanisms.

        With the addition of OpenGL and OpenGL ES 3 support to EGL, the definition of a non-extension function becomes less clear. It is common for one OpenGL
        library to implement many versions of OpenGL. The suggested library name for OpenGL ES 3 is the same as that of OpenGL ES 2. If OpenGL ES 3
        applications linked statically to OpenGL ES 3 functions are run on a system with only OpenGL ES 2 support, they may fail to load. Similar problems
        would be encountered by an application linking statically to various OpenGL functions.

        To avoid requiring applications to fall back to OS-specific dynamic linking mechanisms, this extension drops the requirement that eglGetProcAddress
        return only non-extension functions. If the extension string is present, applications can query all EGL and client API functions using
        eglGetProcAddress.

        To allow users to query this extension before initializing a display, and to also allow vendors to ship this extension without
        EGL_EXT_client_extensions, two names are assigned to this extension: one a display extension and the other a client extension. Identical functionality
        is exposed by each name, but users query each name using different methods. Users query EGL_KHR_get_all_proc_addresses in the usual way; that is, by
        calling eglQueryString(dpy, EGL_EXTENSIONS) on an initialized display. To query EGL_KHR_client_get_all_proc_addresses, users must use a different
        method which is described below in the section concerning EGL_EXT_client_extensions.
