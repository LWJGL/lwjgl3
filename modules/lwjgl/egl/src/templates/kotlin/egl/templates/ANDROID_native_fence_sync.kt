        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension enables the creation of EGL fence sync objects that are associated with a native synchronization fence object that is referenced using a
        file descriptor. These EGL fence sync objects have nearly identical semantics to those defined by the KHR_fence_sync extension, except that they have
        an additional attribute storing the file descriptor referring to the native fence object.

        This extension assumes the existence of a native fence synchronization object that behaves similarly to an EGL fence sync object. These native objects
        must have a signal status like that of an EGLSyncKHR object that indicates whether the fence has ever been signaled. Once signaled the native object's
        signal status may not change again.

        Requires ${EGL11.core} and ${KHR_fence_sync.link}.
