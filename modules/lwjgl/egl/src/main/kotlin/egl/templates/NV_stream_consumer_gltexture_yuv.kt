        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        The EGL_KHR_stream_consumer_gltexture extension allows EGLStream frames to be latched to a GL texture for use in rendering. These frames are assumed to
        be stored in RGB format and accessed as such by shader programs. If the producer uses a different color space, the stream implementation must perform
        an implicit conversion.

        In cases where the producer operates in a native YUV color space, it may be desirable for shaders to directly access the YUV components, without
        conversion. This extension adds a new variant of the function to bind GL textures as stream consumers which allows attributes to specify the color
        space.

        Requires ${KHR_stream_consumer_gltexture.core}.
