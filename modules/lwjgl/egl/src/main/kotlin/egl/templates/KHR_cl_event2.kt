        Native bindings to the $registryLink extension.

        This extension allows creating an EGL sync object linked to an OpenCL event object, potentially improving efficiency of sharing images between the two
        APIs. The companion cl_khr_egl_event extension provides the complementary functionality of creating an OpenCL event object from an EGL sync object.

        This extension is functionally identical to EGL_KHR_cl_event, but is intended to replace that extension. It exists only to address an implementation
        issue on 64-bit platforms where passing OpenCL event handles in an EGLint attribute list value is impossible, because the implementations use a 32-bit
        type for EGLint.

        This extension also incorporates some required functionality from the EGL_KHR_fence_sync extension, similarly modified for 64-bit platforms.

        Requires ${EGL14.core} and ${KHR_fence_sync.link}.
