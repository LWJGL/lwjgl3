        Useful for e.g. packing rectangular textures into an atlas. Does not do rotation.

        This library currently uses the Skyline Bottom-Left algorithm. Not necessarily the awesomest packing method, but better than the totally naive one in

        Assigns packed locations to rectangles. The rectangles are of type ##STBRPRect, stored in the array {@code rects}, and there are {@code num_rects} many

        Rectangles which are successfully packed have the {@code was_packed} flag set to a non-zero value and {@code x} and {@code y} store the minimum
        location on each axis (i.e. bottom-left in cartesian coordinates, top-left if you imagine y increasing downwards). Rectangles which do not fit have the
        {@code was_packed} flag set to 0.

        while it executes.

        array, but the option is available.
