        Native bindings to stb_easy_font.h from the ${url("https://github.com/nothings/stb", "stb library")}.

        Bitmap font for use in 3D APIs:

            "Easy-to-deploy",
            "reasonably compact",

            "ASCII-only"
        )}
        Intended for when you just want to get some text displaying in a 3D app as quickly as possible.

        Doesn't use any textures, instead builds characters out of quads.

        <h3>SAMPLE CODE</h3>

        Here's sample code for old OpenGL; it's a lot more complicated to make work on modern APIs, and that's your problem.

        Takes a string (which can contain '\n') and fills out a vertex buffer with renderable data to draw the string. Output data assumes increasing x is
        rightwards, increasing y is downwards.

        The vertex data is divided into quads, i.e. there are four vertices in the vertex buffer for each quad.

        The vertices are stored in an interleaved format:
        ${codeBlock("""
x:float
y:float
z:float
color:uint8[4]""")}
        You can ignore z and color if you get them from elsewhere. This format was chosen in the hopes it would make it easier for you to reuse existing
        buffer-drawing code.

        If you pass in #NULL for color, it becomes {@code 255,255,255,255}.

        If the buffer isn't large enough, it will truncate. Expect it to use an average of ~270 bytes per character.

        If your API doesn't draw quads, build a reusable index list that allows you to render quads as indexed triangles.

        {@code -0.5} is a reasonable compromise as long as you're scaling the font up.
