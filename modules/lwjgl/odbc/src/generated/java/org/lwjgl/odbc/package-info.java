 * <p>The Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface is a C programming language interface that makes it possible for applications to access data
 * from a variety of database management systems (DBMSs). ODBC is a low-level, high-performance interface that is designed specifically for relational
 * data stores.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The ODBC interface allows maximum interoperability — an application can access data in diverse DBMSs through a single interface. Moreover, that
 * application will be independent of any DBMS from which it accesses data. Users of the application can add software components called drivers, which
 * interface between an application and a specific DBMS.</p>
