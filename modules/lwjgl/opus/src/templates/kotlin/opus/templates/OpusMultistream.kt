        Opus Multistream API

        The multistream API allows individual Opus streams to be combined into a single packet, enabling support for up to 255 channels. Unlike an elementary
        Opus stream, the encoder and decoder must negotiate the channel configuration before the decoder can successfully interpret the data in the packets
        produced by the encoder. Some basic information, such as packet duration, can be computed without any special negotiation.

        The format for multistream Opus packets is defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845">RFC 7845</a> and is based on the self-delimited
        Opus framing described in Appendix B of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716">RFC 6716</a>. Normal Opus packets are just a degenerate case of
        multistream Opus packets, and can be encoded or decoded with the multistream API by setting {@code streams} to {@code 1} when initializing the encoder
        or decoder.

        Multistream Opus streams can contain up to 255 elementary Opus streams. These may be either "uncoupled" or "coupled", indicating that the decoder is
        configured to decode them to either 1 or 2 channels, respectively. The streams are ordered so that all coupled streams appear at the beginning.

        A {@code mapping} table defines which decoded channel {@code i} should be used for each input/output (I/O) channel {@code j}. This table
        is typically provided as an unsigned char array. Let {@code i = mapping[j]} be the index for I/O channel {@code j}. If {@code i < 2*coupled_streams},
        then I/O channel {@code j} is encoded as the left channel of stream {@code (i/2)} if {@code i} is even, or as the right channel of stream {@code (i/2)}
        if {@code i} is odd. Otherwise, I/O channel {@code j} is encoded as mono in stream {@code (i - coupled_streams)}, unless it has the special value 255,
        in which case it is omitted from the encoding entirely (the decoder will reproduce it as silence). Each value {@code i} must either be the special
        value 255 or be less than {@code streams + coupled_streams}.

        The output channels specified by the encoder should use the <a href="https://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html\#x1-810004.3.9">Vorbis channel
        ordering</a>. A decoder may wish to apply an additional permutation to the mapping the encoder used to achieve a different output channel order (e.g.
        for outputing in WAV order).

        Each multistream packet contains an Opus packet for each stream, and all of the Opus packets in a single multistream packet must have the same
        duration. Therefore the duration of a multistream packet can be extracted from the TOC sequence of the first stream, which is located at the beginning
        of the packet, just like an elementary Opus stream:
        ${codeBlock("""
int nb_samples, nb_frames;
nb_frames = opus_packet_get_nb_frames(data, len);
if (nb_frames < 1)
    return nb_frames;
nb_samples = opus_packet_get_samples_per_frame(data, 48000) * nb_frames;""")}

        The general encoding and decoding process proceeds exactly the same as in the normal encoder and decoder APIs. See their documentation for an overview
        of how to use the corresponding multistream functions.
