        <h3>Choosing memory type</h3>

        Physical devices in Vulkan support various combinations of memory heaps and types. Help with choosing correct and optimal memory type for your specific
        resource is one of the key features of this library. You can use it by filling appropriate members of VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure, as described
        below. You can also combine multiple methods.

            "If you just want to find memory type index that meets your requirements, you can use function #FindMemoryTypeIndex().",
            """

            """,
            """
            If you already have a buffer or an image created, you want to allocate memory for it and then you will bind it yourself, you can use function

            """
            If you want to create a buffer or an image, allocate memory for it and bind them together, all in one call, you can use function #CreateBuffer(),

            """
        )}
        When using 3. or 4., the library internally queries Vulkan for memory types supported for that buffer or image (function
        {@code vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements()}) and uses only one of these types.

        If no memory type can be found that meets all the requirements, these functions return {@code VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT}.

        You can leave ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure completely filled with zeros. It means no requirements are specified for memory type. It is valid,
        although not very useful.

        <h4>Usage</h4>

        The easiest way to specify memory requirements is to fill member ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::usage} using one of the values of enum
        {@code VmaMemoryUsage}. It defines high level, common usage types. For more details, see description of this enum.

        For example, if you want to create a uniform buffer that will be filled using transfer only once or infrequently and used for rendering every frame,
        you can do it using following code:

        ${codeBlock("""
VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
bufferInfo.size = 65536;
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
allocInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;

VkBuffer buffer;
VmaAllocation allocation;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);""")}

        <h4>Required and preferred flags</h4>

        You can specify more detailed requirements by filling members ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::requiredFlags} and
        ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::preferredFlags} with a combination of bits from enum {@code VkMemoryPropertyFlags}. For example, if you want to
        create a buffer that will be persistently mapped on host (so it must be {@code HOST_VISIBLE}) and preferably will also be {@code HOST_COHERENT} and
        {@code HOST_CACHED}, use following code:

        ${codeBlock("""
VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
allocInfo.requiredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT;
allocInfo.preferredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT;
allocInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;

VkBuffer buffer;
VmaAllocation allocation;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);""")}

        A memory type is chosen that has all the required flags and as many preferred flags set as possible.

        If you use ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::usage}, it is just internally converted to a set of required and preferred flags.

        <h4>Explicit memory types</h4>

        If you inspected memory types available on the physical device and you have a preference for memory types that you want to use, you can fill member
        ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::memoryTypeBits}. It is a bit mask, where each bit set means that a memory type with that index is allowed to be used
        for the allocation. Special value 0, just like {@code UINT32_MAX}, means there are no restrictions to memory type index.

        Please note that this member is NOT just a memory type index. Still you can use it to choose just one, specific memory type. For example, if you
        already determined that your buffer should be created in memory type 2, use following code:

        ${codeBlock("""
uint32_t memoryTypeIndex = 2;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
allocInfo.memoryTypeBits = 1u << memoryTypeIndex;

VkBuffer buffer;
VmaAllocation allocation;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);""")}

        <h4>Custom memory pools</h4>

        If you allocate from custom memory pool, all the ways of specifying memory requirements described above are not applicable and the aforementioned
        members of ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure are ignored. Memory type is selected explicitly when creating the pool and then used to make all the
        allocations from that pool. For further details, see Custom Memory Pools below.


        <h3>Memory mapping</h3>

        To "map memory" in Vulkan means to obtain a CPU pointer to {@code VkDeviceMemory}, to be able to read from it or write to it in CPU code. Mapping is
        possible only of memory allocated from a memory type that has {@code VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT} flag. Functions {@code vkMapMemory()},
        {@code vkUnmapMemory()} are designed for this purpose. You can use them directly with memory allocated by this library, but it is not recommended
        because of following issue: Mapping the same {@code VkDeviceMemory} block multiple times is illegal - only one mapping at a time is allowed. This
        includes mapping disjoint regions. Mapping is not reference-counted internally by Vulkan. Because of this, Vulkan Memory Allocator provides following
        facilities:

        <h4>Mapping functions</h4>

        The library provides following functions for mapping of a specific {@code VmaAllocation}: #MapMemory(), #UnmapMemory(). They are safer and more
        convenient to use than standard Vulkan functions. You can map an allocation multiple times simultaneously - mapping is reference-counted internally.
        You can also map different allocations simultaneously regardless of whether they use the same {@code VkDeviceMemory} block. They way it's implemented
        is that the library always maps entire memory block, not just region of the allocation. For further details, see description of #MapMemory() function.
        Example:

        ${codeBlock("""
// Having these objects initialized:

struct ConstantBuffer
{
    ...
};
ConstantBuffer constantBufferData;

VmaAllocator allocator;
VmaBuffer constantBuffer;
VmaAllocation constantBufferAllocation;

// You can map and fill your buffer using following code:

void* mappedData;
vmaMapMemory(allocator, constantBufferAllocation, &mappedData);
memcpy(mappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));
vmaUnmapMemory(allocator, constantBufferAllocation);""")}

        <h4>Persistently mapped memory</h4>

        Kepping your memory persistently mapped is generally OK in Vulkan. You don't need to unmap it before using its data on the GPU. The library provides a
        special feature designed for that: Allocations made with #ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT flag set in ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::flags} stay mapped
        all the time, so you can just access CPU pointer to it any time without a need to call any "map" or "unmap" function. Example:

        ${codeBlock("""
VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
bufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);
bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY;
allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;

VkBuffer buf;
VmaAllocation alloc;
VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);

// Buffer is already mapped. You can access its memory.
memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));""")}

        There are some exceptions though, when you should consider mapping memory only for a short period of time:
        ${ul(
            """
            When operating system is Windows 7 or 8.x (Windows 10 is not affected because it uses WDDM2), device is discrete AMD GPU, and memory type is the
            special 256 MiB pool of {@code DEVICE_LOCAL + HOST_VISIBLE} memory (selected when you use #MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU), then whenever a memory block
            allocated from this memory type stays mapped for the time of any call to {@code vkQueueSubmit()} or {@code vkQueuePresentKHR()}, this block is
            migrated by WDDM to system RAM, which degrades performance. It doesn't matter if that particular memory block is actually used by the command
            buffer being submitted.
            """,
            "Keeping many large memory blocks mapped may impact performance or stability of some debugging tools."
        )}

        <h4>Cache control</h4>
  
        Memory in Vulkan doesn't need to be unmapped before using it on GPU, but unless a memory types has {@code VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT} flag
        set, you need to manually invalidate cache before reading of mapped pointer using function {@code vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges()} and flush cache
        after writing to mapped pointer using function {@code vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges()}. Example:

        ${codeBlock("""
memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));

VkMemoryPropertyFlags memFlags;
vmaGetMemoryTypeProperties(allocator, allocInfo.memoryType, &memFlags);
if((memFlags & VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT) == 0)
{
    VkMappedMemoryRange memRange = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MAPPED_MEMORY_RANGE };
    memRange.memory = allocInfo.deviceMemory;
    memRange.offset = allocInfo.offset;
    memRange.size   = allocInfo.size;
    vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges(device, 1, &memRange);
}""")}

        Please note that memory allocated with #MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY is guaranteed to be host coherent.

        Also, Windows drivers from all 3 PC GPU vendors (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA) currently provide {@code VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT} flag on all memory
        types that are {@code VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT}, so on this platform you may not need to bother.

        <h4>Finding out if memory is mappable</h4>

        It may happen that your allocation ends up in memory that is {@code HOST_VISIBLE} (available for mapping) despite it wasn't explicitly requested. For
        example, application may work on integrated graphics with unified memory (like Intel) or allocation from video memory might have failed, so the library
        chose system memory as fallback.

        You can detect this case and map such allocation to access its memory on CPU directly, instead of launching a transfer operation. In order to do that:
        inspect {@code allocInfo.memoryType}, call #GetMemoryTypeProperties(), and look for {@code VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT} flag in properties of
        that memory type.

        You can even use #ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT flag while creating allocations that are not necessarily {@code HOST_VISIBLE} (e.g. using
        #MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY). If the allocation ends up in memory type that is {@code HOST_VISIBL}E, it will be persistently mapped and you can use it
        directly. If not, the flag is just ignored. Example:

        ${code("""
VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
bufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);
bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;

VkBuffer buf;
VmaAllocation alloc;
VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);

if(allocInfo.pUserData != nullptr)
{
    // Allocation ended up in mappable memory.
    // It's persistently mapped. You can access it directly.
    memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));
}
else
{
    // Allocation ended up in non-mappable memory.
    // You need to create CPU-side copy in VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and make a transfer.
}""")}

        <h3>Custom memory pools</h3>

        A memory pool contains a number of {@code VkDeviceMemory} blocks. The library automatically creates and manages default pool for each memory type
        available on the device. Default memory pool automatically grows in size. Size of allocated blocks is also variable and managed automatically.

        You can create custom pool and allocate memory out of it. It can be useful if you want to:
        ${ul(
            "Keep certain kind of allocations separate from others.",
            "Enforce particular, fixed size of Vulkan memory blocks.",
            "Limit maximum amount of Vulkan memory allocated for that pool.",
            "Reserve minimum or fixed amount of Vulkan memory always preallocated for that pool."
        )}

        To use custom memory pools:
        ${ol(
            "Fill ##VmaPoolCreateInfo structure.",
            "Call #CreatePool() to obtain {@code VmaPool} handle.",
            """
            When making an allocation, set ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::pool} to this handle. You don't need to specify any other parameters of this
            structure, like usage.
            """
        )}
        Example:

        ${codeBlock("""
// Create a pool that can have at most 2 blocks, 128 MiB each.
VmaPoolCreateInfo poolCreateInfo = {};
poolCreateInfo.memoryTypeIndex = ...
poolCreateInfo.blockSize = 128ull * 1024 * 1024;
poolCreateInfo.maxBlockCount = 2;

VmaPool pool;
vmaCreatePool(allocator, &poolCreateInfo, &pool);

// Allocate a buffer out of it.
VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
bufCreateInfo.size = 1024;
bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
allocCreateInfo.pool = pool;

VkBuffer buf;
VmaAllocation alloc;
VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);""")}

        You have to free all allocations made from this pool before destroying it.

        ${codeBlock("""
vmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, buf, alloc);
vmaDestroyPool(allocator, pool);""")}

        <h4>Choosing memory type index</h4>

        When creating a pool, you must explicitly specify memory type index. To find the one suitable for your buffers or images, you can use code similar to
        the following:

        ${codeBlock("""
VkBufferCreateInfo dummyBufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
dummyBufCreateInfo.size = 1024; // Whatever.
dummyBufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT; // Change if needed.

VkBuffer dummyBuf;
vkCreateBuffer(device, &dummyBufCreateInfo, nullptr, &dummyBuf);

VkMemoryRequirements memReq;
vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements(device, dummyBuf, &memReq);

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY; // Change if needed.

uint32_t memTypeIndex;
vmaFindMemoryTypeIndex(allocator, memReq.memoryTypeBits, &allocCreateInfo, &memTypeIndex);

vkDestroyBuffer(device, dummyBuf, nullptr);

VmaPoolCreateInfo poolCreateInfo = {};
poolCreateInfo.memoryTypeIndex = memTypeIndex;
// ...""")}

        Dummy buffer is needed to query driver for {@code memReq.memoryTypeBits}. Memory is never allocated for this buffer. You should fill structures
        {@code dummyBufCreateInfo} and {@code allocCreateInfo} with the same parameters as you are going to use for buffers created in your pool.

        <h3>Defragmentation</h3>

        Interleaved allocations and deallocations of many objects of varying size can cause fragmentation, which can lead to a situation where the library is
        unable to find a continuous range of free memory for a new allocation despite there is enough free space, just scattered across many small free ranges
        between existing allocations.

        To mitigate this problem, you can use #Defragment(). Given set of allocations, this function can move them to compact used memory, ensure more
        continuous free space and possibly also free some {@code VkDeviceMemory}. It can work only on allocations made from memory type that is
        {@code HOST_VISIBLE}. Allocations are modified to point to the new {@code VkDeviceMemory} and offset. Data in this memory is also {@code memmove}-ed to
        the new place. However, if you have images or buffers bound to these allocations (and you certainly do), you need to destroy, recreate, and bind them
        to the new place in memory.

        For further details and example code, see documentation of function #Defragment().

        <h3>Lost allocations</h3>

        If your game oversubscribes video memory, it may work OK in previous-generation graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 10, 11, OpenGL) because resources are
        automatically paged to system RAM. In Vulkan you can't do it because when you run out of memory, an allocation just fails. If you have more data (e.g.
        textures) than can fit into VRAM and you don't need it all at once, you may want to upload them to GPU on demand and "push out" ones that are not used
        for a long time to make room for the new ones, effectively using VRAM (or a cartain memory pool) as a form of cache. Vulkan Memory Allocator can help
        you with that by supporting a concept of "lost allocations".

        To create an allocation that can become lost, include #ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT flag in ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::flags}. Before
        using a buffer or image bound to such allocation in every new frame, you need to query it if it's not lost. To check it: call #GetAllocationInfo() and
        see if ##VmaAllocationInfo{@code ::deviceMemory} is not {@code VK_NULL_HANDLE}. If the allocation is lost, you should not use it or buffer/image bound
        to it. You mustn't forget to destroy this allocation and this buffer/image.

        To create an allocation that can make some other allocations lost to make room for it, use #ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag. You will
        usually use both flags #ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT and #ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT at the same time.

        Warning! Current implementation uses quite naive, brute force algorithm, which can make allocation calls that use
        #ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag quite slow. A new, more optimal algorithm and data structure to speed this up is planned for the
        future.

        <b>When interleaving creation of new allocations with usage of existing ones, how do you make sure that an allocation won't become lost while it's used
        in the current frame?</b>

        It is ensured because #GetAllocationInfo() not only returns allocation parameters and checks whether it's not lost, but when it's not, it also
        atomically marks it as used in the current frame, which makes it impossible to become lost in that frame. It uses lockless algorithm, so it works fast
        and doesn't involve locking any internal mutex.

        <b>What if my allocation may still be in use by the GPU when it's rendering a previous frame while I already submit new frame on the CPU?</b>

        You can make sure that allocations "touched" by #GetAllocationInfo() will not become lost for a number of additional frames back from the current one
        by specifying this number as ##VmaAllocatorCreateInfo{@code ::frameInUseCount} (for default memory pool) and
        ##VmaPoolCreateInfo{@code ::frameInUseCount} (for custom pool).

        <b>How do you inform the library when new frame starts?</b>

        You need to call function #SetCurrentFrameIndex().

        Example code:

        ${codeBlock("""
struct MyBuffer
{
    VkBuffer m_Buf = nullptr;
    VmaAllocation m_Alloc = nullptr;

    // Called when the buffer is really needed in the current frame.
    void EnsureBuffer();
};

void MyBuffer::EnsureBuffer()
{
    // Buffer has been created.
    if(m_Buf != VK_NULL_HANDLE)
    {
        // Check if its allocation is not lost + mark it as used in current frame.
        VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
        vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, m_Alloc, &allocInfo);
        if(allocInfo.deviceMemory != VK_NULL_HANDLE)
        {
            // It's all OK - safe to use m_Buf.
            return;
        }
    }

    // Buffer not yet exists or lost - destroy and recreate it.

    vmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, m_Buf, m_Alloc);

    VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
    bufCreateInfo.size = 1024;
    bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

    VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
    allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
    allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT |
        VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT;

    vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &m_Buf, &m_Alloc, nullptr);
}""")}

        When using lost allocations, you may see some Vulkan validation layer warnings about overlapping regions of memory bound to different kinds of buffers
        and images. This is still valid as long as you implement proper handling of lost allocations (like in the example above) and don't use them.

        The library uses following algorithm for allocation, in order:
        ${ol(
            "Try to find free range of memory in existing blocks.",
            "If failed, try to create a new block of {@code VkDeviceMemor}y, with preferred block size.",
            "If failed, try to create such block with {@code size/2} and {@code size/4}.",
            """
            If failed and #ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag was specified, try to find space in existing blocks, possilby making some other
            allocations lost.
            """,
            "If failed, try to allocate separate {@code VkDeviceMemory} for this allocation, just like when you use #ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT.",
            "If failed, choose other memory type that meets the requirements specified in ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo and go to point 1.",
            "If failed, return {@code VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY}."
        )}

        You can annotate allocations with your own information, e.g. for debugging purposes. To do that, fill ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::pUserData}
        field when creating an allocation. It's an opaque {@code void*} pointer. You can use it e.g. as a pointer, some handle, index, key, ordinal number or
        any other value that would associate the allocation with your custom metadata.

        ${codeBlock("""
VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
// Fill bufferInfo...

MyBufferMetadata* pMetadata = CreateBufferMetadata();

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
allocCreateInfo.pUserData = pMetadata;

VkBuffer buffer;
VmaAllocation allocation;
vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);""")}

        The pointer may be later retrieved as ##VmaAllocationInfo{@code ::pUserData}:

        ${codeBlock("""
VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocation, &allocInfo);
MyBufferMetadata* pMetadata = (MyBufferMetadata*)allocInfo.pUserData;""")}

        It can also be changed using function #SetAllocationUserData().

        Values of (non-zero) allocations' {@code pUserData} are printed in JSON report created by #BuildStatsString(), in hexadecimal form.

        <h4>Allocation names</h4>

        There is alternative mode available where {@code pUserData} pointer is used to point to a null-terminated string, giving a name to the allocation. To
        use this mode, set #ALLOCATION_CREATE_USER_DATA_COPY_STRING_BIT flag in ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::flags}. Then {@code pUserData} passed as
        ##VmaAllocationCreateInfo{@code ::pUserData} or argument to #SetAllocationUserData() must be either null or pointer to a null-terminated string. The
        library creates internal copy of the string, so the pointer you pass doesn't need to be valid for whole lifetime of the allocation. You can free it
        after the call.

        ${codeBlock("""
VkImageCreateInfo imageInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO };
// Fill imageInfo...

std::string imageName = "Texture: ";
imageName += fileName;

VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_USER_DATA_COPY_STRING_BIT;
allocCreateInfo.pUserData = imageName.c_str();

VkImage image;
VmaAllocation allocation;
vmaCreateImage(allocator, &imageInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &image, &allocation, nullptr);""")}

        The value of {@code pUserData} pointer of the allocation will be different than the one you passed when setting allocation's name - pointing to a
        buffer managed internally that holds copy of the string.

        ${codeBlock("""
VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocation, &allocInfo);
const char* imageName = (const char*)allocInfo.pUserData;
printf("Image name: %s\n", imageName);""")}

        That string is also printed in JSON report created by #BuildStatsString().

        <h3>Configuration</h3>

        <h4>Custom host memory allocator</h4>

        If you use custom allocator for CPU memory rather than default operator {@code new} and {@code delete} from C++, you can make this library using your
        allocator as well by filling optional member ##VmaAllocatorCreateInfo{@code ::pAllocationCallbacks}. These functions will be passed to Vulkan, as well
        as used by the library itself to make any CPU-side allocations.

        <h4>Device memory allocation callbacks</h4>

        The library makes calls to {@code vkAllocateMemory()} and {@code vkFreeMemory()} internally. You can setup callbacks to be informed about these calls,
        e.g. for the purpose of gathering some statistics. To do it, fill optional member ##VmaAllocatorCreateInfo{@code ::pDeviceMemoryCallbacks}.

        <h4>Device heap memory limit</h4>

        If you want to test how your program behaves with limited amount of Vulkan device memory available without switching your graphics card to one that
        really has smaller VRAM, you can use a feature of this library intended for this purpose. To do it, fill optional member
        ##VmaAllocatorCreateInfo{@code ::pHeapSizeLimit}.

        <h3>VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation</h3>

        {@code VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation} is a Vulkan extension which can be used to improve performance on some GPUs. It augments Vulkan API with
        possibility to query driver whether it prefers particular buffer or image to have its own, dedicated allocation (separate {@code VkDeviceMemory} block)
        for better efficiency - to be able to do some internal optimizations.

        The extension is supported by this library. It will be used automatically when enabled. To enable it:

        1 . When creating Vulkan device, check if following 2 device extensions are supported (call {@code vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties()}). If yes,
        enable them (fill ##VkDeviceCreateInfo{@code ::ppEnabledExtensionNames}).

        ${ul(
            "{@code VK_KHR_get_memory_requirements2}",
            "{@code VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation}"
        )}

        If you enabled these extensions:

        2 . Use #ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT flag when creating your {@code VmaAllocator} to inform the library that you enabled required
        extensions and you want the library to use them.

        ${codeBlock("""
allocatorInfo.flags |= VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT;

vmaCreateAllocator(&allocatorInfo, &allocator);""")}

        That's all. The extension will be automatically used whenever you create a buffer using #CreateBuffer() or image using #CreateImage().

        When using the extension together with Vulkan Validation Layer, you will receive warnings like this:
${codeBlock("""
vkBindBufferMemory(): Binding memory to buffer 0x33 but vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements() has not been called on that buffer.""")}

        It is OK, you should just ignore it. It happens because you use function {@code vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements2KHR()} instead of standard
        {@code vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements()}, while the validation layer seems to be unaware of it.

        the number and size of data that needs to be moved. Some fragmentation still remains after this call. This is normal.

        Warning: This function is not 100% correct according to Vulkan specification. Use it at your own risk. That's because Vulkan doesn't guarantee that
        memory requirements (size and alignment) for a new buffer or image are consistent. They may be different even for subsequent calls with the same
        parameters. It really does happen on some platforms, especially with images.

        Warning: This function may be time-consuming, so you shouldn't call it too often (like every frame or after every resource creation/destruction). You
        can call it on special occasions (like when reloading a game level or when you just destroyed a lot of objects).
