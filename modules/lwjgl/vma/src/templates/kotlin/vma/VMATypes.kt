        Contains bindings to ${url("https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator", "Vulkan")}, an easy to integrate Vulkan memory
        allocation library.

        <h4>Problem</h4>

        Memory allocation and resource (buffer and image) creation in Vulkan is difficult (comparing to older graphics API-s, like D3D11 or OpenGL) for several
        reasons:
        ${ul(
            "It requires a lot of boilerplate code, just like everything else in Vulkan, because it is a low-level and high-performance API.",
            """
            There is additional level of indirection: {@code VkDeviceMemory} is allocated separately from creating {@code VkBuffer/VkImage} and they must be
            bound together. The binding cannot be changed later - resource must be recreated.
            """,
            "Driver must be queried for supported memory heaps and memory types. Different IHVs provide different types of it.",
            "It is recommended practice to allocate bigger chunks of memory and assign parts of them to particular resources."
        )}

        <h4>Features</h4>

        This library can help game developers to manage memory allocations and resource creation by offering some higher-level functions. Features of the
        library are divided into several layers, low level to high level:

        ${ol(
            """
            Functions that help to choose correct and optimal memory type based on intended usage of the memory.

            """,
            """
            Functions that allocate memory blocks, reserve and return parts of them (`VkDeviceMemory` + offset + size) to the user.

            all the rules of alignment and buffer/image granularity into consideration.
            """,
            "Functions that can create an image/buffer, allocate memory for it and bind them together - all in one call."
