        Bindings to ${url("https://github.com/mlabbe/nativefiledialog", "Native File Dialog")}, a tiny, neat C library that portably invokes native file open
        and save dialogs. Write dialog code once and have it pop up native dialogs on all supported platforms.

        <h3>Usage</h3>
        ${ul(
            "<a href=\"https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/samples/src/test/java/org/lwjgl/demo/util/nfd/HelloNFD.java\\#L97\">Single file open dialog</a>",
            "<a href=\"https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/samples/src/test/java/org/lwjgl/demo/util/nfd/HelloNFD.java\\#L119\">Multiple file open dialog</a>",
            "<a href=\"https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/samples/src/test/java/org/lwjgl/demo/util/nfd/HelloNFD.java\\#L140\">Save dialog</a>"
        )}

        <h3>File Filter Syntax</h3>

        There is a form of file filtering in every file dialog, but no consistent means of supporting it. NFD provides support for filtering files by groups of
        extensions, providing its own descriptions (where applicable) for the extensions.

        A wildcard filter is always added to every dialog.

        Separators:
        ${ul(
            "<i>;</i> Begin a new filter.",
            "<i>,</i> Add a separate type to the filter."
        )}

        Examples:
        ${ul(
            "<i>txt</i> The default filter is for text files. There is a wildcard option in a dropdown.",
            "<i>png,jpg;psd</i> The default filter is for png and jpg files. A second filter is available for psd files. There is a wildcard option in a dropdown.",
            "#NULL Wildcard only."
        )}

        <h3>Known Limitations</h3>
        ${ul(
            "No support for Windows XP's legacy dialogs such as GetOpenFileName.",
            "No support for file filter names -- ex: \"Image Files\" (*.png, *.jpg). Nameless filters are supported, though.",
            "No support for selecting folders instead of files.",
            "On Linux, GTK+ cannot be uninitialized to save memory. Launching a file dialog costs memory."
