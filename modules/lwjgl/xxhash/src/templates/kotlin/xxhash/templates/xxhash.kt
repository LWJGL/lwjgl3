        xxHash is an extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits. It also successfully passes all tests from the SMHasher suite.

        A 64-bit version, named XXH64, is available since r35. It offers much better speed, but for 64-bit applications only.
        
        <h3>Streaming</h3>

        Streaming functions generate the xxHash value from an incremental input. This method is slower than single-call functions, due to state management. For
        small inputs, prefer #32() and #64(), which are better optimized.

        XXH state must first be allocated, using #32_createState().

        Start a new hash by initializing state with a seed, using #32_reset().

        Then, feed the hash state by calling #32_update() as many times as necessary. Obviously, input must be allocated and read accessible. The function
        returns an error code, with 0 meaning OK, and any other value meaning there is an error.

        Finally, a hash value can be produced anytime, by using #32_digest(). This function returns the 32-bits hash as an int.

        It's still possible to continue inserting input into the hash state after a digest, and generate some new hash values later on, by calling again
        #32_digest().

        When done, release the state, using #32_freeState().
        
        Example code for incrementally hashing a file:
        ${codeBlock("""
\#include <stdio.h>
\#include <xxhash.h>
\#define BUFFER_SIZE 256

// Note: XXH64 and XXH3 use the same interface.
XXH32_hash_t
hashFile(FILE* stream)
{
    XXH32_state_t* state;
    unsigned char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];
    size_t amt;
    XXH32_hash_t hash;

    state = XXH32_createState();       // Create a state
    assert(state != NULL);             // Error check here
    XXH32_reset(state, 0xbaad5eed);    // Reset state with our seed
    while ((amt = fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), stream)) != 0) {
        XXH32_update(state, buf, amt); // Hash the file in chunks
    }
    hash = XXH32_digest(state);        // Finalize the hash
    XXH32_freeState(state);            // Clean up
    return hash;
}""")}

        <h3>Canonical representation</h3>

        The default return values from XXH functions are unsigned 32 and 64 bit integers. This the simplest and fastest format for further post-processing.

        However, this leaves open the question of what is the order on the byte level, since little and big endian conventions will store the same number
        differently.

        The canonical representation settles this issue by mandating big-endian convention, the same convention as human-readable numbers (large digits first).

        When writing hash values to storage, sending them over a network, or printing them, it's highly recommended to use the canonical representation to
        ensure portability across a wider range of systems, present and future.

        <h3>XXH3</h3>

        XXH3 is a more recent hash algorithm featuring:
        ${ul(
            "Improved speed for both small and large inputs",
            "True 64-bit and 128-bit outputs",
            "SIMD acceleration",
            "Improved 32-bit viability"
        )}

        Speed analysis methodology is explained here:

        ${url("https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html")}

        Compared to XXH64, expect XXH3 to run approximately ~2x faster on large inputs and &gt;3x faster on small ones, exact differences vary depending on
        platform.

        XXH3's speed benefits greatly from SIMD and 64-bit arithmetic, but does not require it. Most 32-bit and 64-bit targets that can run XXH32 smoothly can
        run XXH3 at competitive speeds, even without vector support. Further details are explained in the implementation.

        Optimized implementations are provided for AVX512, AVX2, SSE2, NEON, POWER8, ZVector and scalar targets. This can be controlled via the XXH_VECTOR
        macro.
        
        XXH3 implementation is portable:
        ${ul(
            "it has a generic C90 formulation that can be compiled on any platform,",
            "all implementations generage exactly the same hash value on all platforms.",
            "Starting from v0.8.0, it's also labelled \"stable\", meaning that any future version will also generate the same hash value."
        )}

        XXH3 offers 2 variants, {@code _64bits} and {@code _128bits}. When only 64 bits are needed, prefer invoking the {@code _64bits} variant, as it reduces
        the amount of mixing, resulting in faster speed on small inputs. It's also generally simpler to manipulate a scalar return type than a struct.

        The API supports one-shot hashing, streaming mode, and custom secrets.
        
        <h3>*_withSecretandSeed()</h3>

        These variants generate hash values using either {@code seed} for "short" keys (&lt; {@code XXH3_MIDSIZE_MAX = 240 bytes}) or {@code secret} for
        "large" keys (&ge; {@code XXH3_MIDSIZE_MAX}).

        This generally benefits speed, compared to {@code _withSeed()} or {@code _withSecret()}. {@code _withSeed()} has to generate the secret on the fly for
        "large" keys. It's fast, but can be perceptible for "not so large" keys (&lt; 1 KB). {@code _withSecret()} has to generate the masks on the fly for
        "small" keys, which requires more instructions than {@code _withSeed()} variants. Therefore, {@code _withSecretandSeed} variant combines the best of
        both worlds.

        When {@code secret} has been generated by #3_generateSecret_fromSeed(), this variant produces <b>exactly</b> the same results as {@code _withSeed()`}
        variant, hence offering only a pure speed benefit on "large" input, by skipping the need to regenerate the secret for every large input.

        Another usage scenario is to hash the secret to a 64-bit hash value, for example with #3_64bits(), which then becomes the seed, and then employ both
        the seed and the secret in {@code _withSecretandSeed()}. On top of speed, an added benefit is that each bit in the secret has a 50% chance to swap each
        bit in the output, via its impact to the seed. This is not guaranteed when using the secret directly in "small data" scenarios, because only portions
        of the secret are employed for small data.
