        xxHash is an extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits. It also successfully passes all tests from the SMHasher suite.

        A 64-bit version, named XXH64, is available since r35. It offers much better speed, but for 64-bit applications only.

        <h3>XXH3</h3>

        XXH3 is a new hash algorithm, featuring improved speed performance for both small and large inputs. See full speed analysis at:
        <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">Presenting XXH3</a>
        
        In general, expect XXH3 to run about ~2x faster on large inputs, and &gt;3x faster on small ones, though exact differences depend on platform.
 
        The algorithm is portable, will generate the same hash on all platforms. It benefits greatly from vectorization units, but does not require it.

        XXH3 offers 2 variants, {@code _64bits} and {@code _128bits}. When only 64 bits are needed, prefer calling the {@code _64bits} variant: it reduces the
        amount of mixing, resulting in faster speed on small inputs. It's also generally simpler to manipulate a scalar return type than a struct.

        The XXH3 algorithm is still considered experimental. Produced results can still change between versions. Results produced by v0.7.x are not comparable
        with results from v0.7.y. It's nonetheless possible to use XXH3 for ephemeral data (local sessions), but avoid storing values in long-term storage for
        later reads.

        The API supports one-shot hashing, streaming mode, and custom secrets.
