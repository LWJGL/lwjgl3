        Loads and links a dynamic library or bundle.

        This function examines the Mach-O file specified by path. If the image is compatible with the current process and has not already been loaded into the
        process, the image is loaded and linked. If the image contains initializer functions, they are executed before this function returns.

        Subsequent calls to {@code dlopen} to load the same image return the same handle, but the internal reference count for the handle is incremented.
        Therefore, all {@code dlopen} calls must be balanced with #dlclose() calls.

        For efficiency, the #RTLD_LAZY binding mode is preferred over #RTLD_NOW. However, using #RTLD_NOW ensures that any undefined
        symbols are discovered during the call to {@code dlopen}.

        The dynamic loader looks in the paths specified by a set of environment variables, and in the process's current directory, when it searches for a
        library. These paths are called dynamic loader search paths. The environment variables are {@code LD_LIBRARY_PATH}, {@code DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}, and
        {@code DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH}. The default value of {@code DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH} (used when this variable is not set), is
        {@code ${'$'}HOME/lib;/usr/local/lib;/usr/lib}.

        The order in which the search paths are searched depends on whether path is a filename (it does not contain a slash) or a pathname (it contains at least
        one slash).

        When path is a filename, the dynamic loader searches for the library in the search paths in the following order:
        ${ul(
            "${'$'}LD_LIBRARY_PATH",
            "${'$'}DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH",
            "The process's working directory",
            "${'$'}DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH"
        )}
        When path is a pathname, the dynamic loader searches for the library in the search paths in the following order:
        ${ul(
            "${'$'}DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH",
            "The given pathname",
            "${'$'}DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH using the filename"
