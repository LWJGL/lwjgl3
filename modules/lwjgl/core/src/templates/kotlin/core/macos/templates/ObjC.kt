        Native bindings to the Objective-C Runtime.

        Due to the nature of the {@code objc_msgSend*} functions, they are not directly exposed in this binding. Advanced users with good understanding of the
        complexity involved with using these functions, may access them via the ObjCRuntime#getLibrary() method:
        ${codeBlock("""
SharedLibrary objc = ObjCRuntime.getLibrary();
long objc_msgSend = objc.getFunctionAddress("objc_msgSend");

// example usage
long NSThread = objc_getClass("NSThread");
long currentThread = invokePPP(objc_msgSend, NSThread, sel_getUid("currentThread"));""")}
        The safe way to use objc_msgSend in C code is to cast it to an appropriate function pointer. This is exactly what the {@link org.lwjgl.system.JNI JNI}
        class does. If a particular function signature is not available, {@link org.lwjgl.system.dyncall.DynCall DynCall} may be used to invoke it.

        The functions not exposed are:
        ${ul(
            "objc_msgSend",
            "objc_msgSend_stret",
