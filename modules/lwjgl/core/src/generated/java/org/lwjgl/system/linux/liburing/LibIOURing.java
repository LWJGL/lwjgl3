/**
 * Native bindings to <a href="https://github.com/axboe/liburing">io_uring</a>, a Linux-specific API for asynchronous I/O.
 * 
 * <p>It allows the user to submit one or more I/O requests, which are processed asynchronously without blocking the calling process. {@code io_uring} gets
 * its name from ring buffers which are shared between user space and kernel space. This arrangement allows for efficient I/O, while avoiding the overhead
 * of copying buffers between them, where possible. This interface makes {@code io_uring} different from other UNIX I/O APIs, wherein, rather than just
 * communicate between kernel and user space with system calls, ring buffers are used as the main mode of communication. This arrangement has various
 * performance benefits which are discussed in a separate section below. This man page uses the terms shared buffers, shared ring buffers and queues
 * interchangeably.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The general programming model you need to follow for io_uring is outlined below</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Set up shared buffers with {@link #io_uring_setup setup} and {@code mmap(2)}, mapping into user space shared buffers for the submission queue (SQ) and the completion
 * queue (CQ). You place I/O requests you want to make on the SQ, while the kernel places the results of those operations on the CQ.</li>
 * <li>For every I/O request you need to make (like to read a file, write a file, accept a socket connection, etc), you create a submission queue entry,
 * or SQE, describe the I/O operation you need to get done and add it to the tail of the submission queue (SQ). Each I/O operation is, in essence, the
 * equivalent of a system call you would have made otherwise, if you were not using {@code io_uring}. You can add more than one SQE to the queue
 * depending on the number of operations you want to request.</li>
 * <li>After you add one or more SQEs, you need to call {@link #io_uring_enter enter} to tell the kernel to dequeue your I/O requests off the SQ and begin processing them.</li>
 * <li>For each SQE you submit, once it is done processing the request, the kernel places a completion queue event or CQE at the tail of the completion
 * queue or CQ. The kernel places exactly one matching CQE in the CQ for every SQE you submit on the SQ. After you retrieve a CQE, minimally, you
 * might be interested in checking the res field of the CQE structure, which corresponds to the return value of the system call's equivalent, had you
 * used it directly without using {@code io_uring}. For instance, a read operation under {@code io_uring}, started with the {@link #IORING_OP_READ OP_READ} operation, which
 * issues the equivalent of the {@code read(2)} system call, would return as part of {@code res} what {@code read(2)} would have returned if called
 * directly, without using {@code io_uring}.</li>
 * <li>Optionally, {@link #io_uring_enter enter} can also wait for a specified number of requests to be processed by the kernel before it returns. If you specified a certain
 * number of completions to wait for, the kernel would have placed at least those many number of CQEs on the CQ, which you can then readily read,
 * right after the return from {@code io_uring_enter(2)}.</li>
 * <li>It is important to remember that I/O requests submitted to the kernel can complete in any order. It is not necessary for the kernel to process one
 * request after another, in the order you placed them. Given that the interface is a ring, the requests are attempted in order, however that doesn't
 * imply any sort of ordering on their completion. When more than one request is in flight, it is not possible to determine which one will complete
 * first. When you dequeue CQEs off the CQ, you should always check which submitted request it corresponds to. The most common method for doing so is
 * utilizing the {@code user_data} field in the request, which is passed back on the completion side.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Adding to and reading from the queues:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>You add SQEs to the tail of the SQ. The kernel reads SQEs off the head of the queue.</li>
 * <li>The kernel adds CQEs to the tail of the CQ. You read CQEs off the head of the queue.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Submission queue polling</h3>
 * 
 * <p>One of the goals of {@code io_uring} is to provide a means for efficient I/O. To this end, {@code io_uring} supports a polling mode that lets you avoid
 * the call to {@link #io_uring_enter enter}, which you use to inform the kernel that you have queued SQEs on to the SQ. With SQ Polling, {@code io_uring} starts a kernel
 * thread that polls the submission queue for any I/O requests you submit by adding SQEs. With SQ Polling enabled, there is no need for you to call
 * {@code io_uring_enter(2)}, letting you avoid the overhead of system calls. A designated kernel thread dequeues SQEs off the SQ as you add them and
 * dispatches them for asynchronous processing.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Setting up io_uring</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The main steps in setting up {@code io_uring} consist of mapping in the shared buffers with {@code mmap(2)} calls.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Submitting I/O requests</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The process of submitting a request consists of describing the I/O operation you need to get done using an {@code io_uring_sqe} structure instance.
 * These details describe the equivalent system call and its parameters. Because the range of I/O operations Linux supports are very varied and the
 * {@code io_uring_sqe} structure needs to be able to describe them, it has several fields, some packed into unions for space efficiency.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To submit an I/O request to {@code io_uring}, you need to acquire a submission queue entry (SQE) from the submission queue (SQ), fill it up with
 * details of the operation you want to submit and call {@link #io_uring_enter enter}. If you want to avoid calling {@code io_uring_enter(2)}, you have the option of setting
 * up Submission Queue Polling.</p>
 * 
 * <p>SQEs are added to the tail of the submission queue. The kernel picks up SQEs off the head of the SQ. The general algorithm to get the next available
 * SQE and update the tail is as follows.</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * struct io_uring_sqe *sqe;
 * unsigned tail, index;
 * tail = *sqring-&gt;tail;
 * index = tail &amp; (*sqring-&gt;ring_mask);
 * sqe = &amp;sqring-&gt;sqes[index];
 * // fill up details about this I/O request
 * describe_io(sqe);
 * // fill the sqe index into the SQ ring array
 * sqring-&gt;array[index] = index;
 * tail++;
 * atomic_store_release(sqring-&gt;tail, tail);</code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>To get the index of an entry, the application must mask the current tail index with the size mask of the ring. This holds true for both SQs and CQs.
 * Once the SQE is acquired, the necessary fields are filled in, describing the request. While the CQ ring directly indexes the shared array of CQEs, the
 * submission side has an indirection array between them. The submission side ring buffer is an index into this array, which in turn contains the index
 * into the SQEs.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The following code snippet demonstrates how a read operation, an equivalent of a preadv2(2) system call is described by filling up an SQE with the
 * necessary parameters.</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * struct iovec iovecs[16];
 *  ...
 * sqe-&gt;opcode = IORING_OP_READV;
 * sqe-&gt;fd = fd;
 * sqe-&gt;addr = (unsigned long) iovecs;
 * sqe-&gt;len = 16;
 * sqe-&gt;off = offset;
 * sqe-&gt;flags = 0;</code></pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Memory ordering</h4>
 * 
 * <p>Modern compilers and CPUs freely reorder reads and writes without affecting the program's outcome to optimize performance. Some aspects of this need to
 * be kept in mind on SMP systems since {@code io_uring} involves buffers shared between kernel and user space. These buffers are both visible and
 * modifiable from kernel and user space. As heads and tails belonging to these shared buffers are updated by kernel and user space, changes need to be
 * coherently visible on either side, irrespective of whether a CPU switch took place after the kernel-user mode switch happened. We use memory barriers
 * to enforce this coherency. Being significantly large subjects on their own, memory barriers are out of scope for further discussion on this man page.</p>
 * 
 * <h4>Letting the kernel know about I/O submissions</h4>
 * 
 * <p>Once you place one or more SQEs on to the SQ, you need to let the kernel know that you've done so. You can do this by calling the {@link #io_uring_enter enter} system call.
 * This system call is also capable of waiting for a specified count of events to complete. This way, you can be sure to find completion events in the
 * completion queue without having to poll it for events later.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Reading completion events</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Similar to the submission queue (SQ), the completion queue (CQ) is a shared buffer between the kernel and user space. Whereas you placed submission
 * queue entries on the tail of the SQ and the kernel read off the head, when it comes to the CQ, the kernel places completion queue events or CQEs on the
 * tail of the CQ and you read off its head.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Submission is flexible (and thus a bit more complicated) since it needs to be able to encode different types of system calls that take various
 * parameters. Completion, on the other hand is simpler since we're looking only for a return value back from the kernel. This is easily understood by
 * looking at the completion queue event structure, {@link IOURingCQE}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Here, {@code user_data} is custom data that is passed unchanged from submission to completion. That is, from SQEs to CQEs. This field can be used to
 * set context, uniquely identifying submissions that got completed. Given that I/O requests can complete in any order, this field can be used to
 * correlate a submission with a completion. {@code res} is the result from the system call that was performed as part of the submission; its return
 * value. The {@code flags} field could carry request-specific metadata in the future, but is currently unused.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The general sequence to read completion events off the completion queue is as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * unsigned head;
 * head = *cqring-&gt;head;
 * if (head != atomic_load_acquire(cqring-&gt;tail)) {
 *     struct io_uring_cqe *cqe;
 * 
 *     unsigned index;
 * 
 *     index = head &amp; (cqring-&gt;mask);
 * 
 *     cqe = &amp;cqring-&gt;cqes[index];
 * 
 *     // process completed CQE
 * 
 *     process_cqe(cqe);
 * 
 *     // CQE consumption complete
 * 
 *     head++;
 * }
 * atomic_store_release(cqring-&gt;head, head);</code></pre>
 * 
 * <p>It helps to be reminded that the kernel adds CQEs to the tail of the CQ, while you need to dequeue them off the head. To get the index of an entry at
 * the head, the application must mask the current head index with the size mask of the ring. Once the CQE has been consumed or processed, the head needs
 * to be updated to reflect the consumption of the CQE. Attention should be paid to the read and write barriers to ensure successful read and update of
 * the head.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>io_uring performance</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Because of the shared ring buffers between kernel and user space, {@code io_uring} can be a zero-copy system. Copying buffers to and from becomes
 * necessary when system calls that transfer data between kernel and user space are involved. But since the bulk of the communication in {@code io_uring}
 * is via buffers shared between the kernel and user space, this huge performance overhead is completely avoided.</p>
 * 
 * <p>While system calls may not seem like a significant overhead, in high performance applications, making a lot of them will begin to matter. While
 * workarounds the operating system has in place to deal with Spectre and Meltdown are ideally best done away with, unfortunately, some of these
 * workarounds are around the system call interface, making system calls not as cheap as before on affected hardware. While newer hardware should not need
 * these workarounds, hardware with these vulnerabilities can be expected to be in the wild for a long time. While using synchronous programming
 * interfaces or even when using asynchronous programming interfaces under Linux, there is at least one system call involved in the submission of each
 * request. In {@code io_uring}, on the other hand, you can batch several requests in one go, simply by queueing up multiple SQEs, each describing an I/O
 * operation you want and make a single call to {@link #io_uring_enter enter}. This is possible due to {@code io_uring}'s shared buffers based design.</p>
 * 
 * <p>While this batching in itself can avoid the overhead associated with potentially multiple and frequent system calls, you can reduce even this overhead
 * further with Submission Queue Polling, by having the kernel poll and pick up your SQEs for processing as you add them to the submission queue. This
 * avoids the {@code io_uring_enter(2)} call you need to make to tell the kernel to pick SQEs up. For high-performance applications, this means even
 * lesser system call overheads.</p>

     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IOSQE_ASYNC IOSQE_ASYNC} - 
     * Normal operation for {@code io_uring} is to try and issue an sqe as non-blocking first, and if that fails, execute it in an async manner.
     * 
     * <p>To support more efficient overlapped operation of requests that the application knows/assumes will always (or most of the time) block, the

     * Used in conjunction with the {@link #IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS} command, which registers a pool of buffers to be used by commands that read or receive data.
     * 
     * <p>When buffers are registered for this use case, and this flag is set in the command, {@code io_uring} will grab a buffer from this pool when the

     * upper {@link #IORING_CQE_BUFFER_SHIFT CQE_BUFFER_SHIFT} bits will contain the ID of the selected buffers. This allows the application to know exactly which buffer was selected for
     * the operation. If no buffers are available and this flag is set, then the request will fail with {@code -ENOBUFS} as the error code. Once a buffer
     * has been used, it is no longer available in the kernel pool. The application must re-register the given buffer again when it is ready to recycle it

     * Don't generate a CQE if the request completes successfully.
     * 
     * <p>If the request fails, an appropriate CQE will be posted as usual and if there is no {@link #IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK}, CQEs for all linked requests will be
     * omitted. The notion of failure/success is {@code opcode} specific and is the same as with breaking chains of {@link #IOSQE_IO_LINK}. One special case is
     * when the request has a linked timeout, then the CQE generation for the linked timeout is decided solely by whether it has
     * {@code IOSQE_CQE_SKIP_SUCCESS} set, regardless whether it timed out or was cancelled. In other words, if a linked timeout has the flag set, it's
     * guaranteed to not post a CQE.</p>
     * 
     * <p>The semantics are chosen to accommodate several use cases. First, when all but the last request of a normal link without linked timeouts are marked
     * with the flag, only one CQE per link is posted. Additionally, it enables supression of CQEs in cases where the side effects of a successfully
     * executed operation is enough for userspace to know the state of the system. One such example would be writing to a synchronisation file.</p>
     * 
     * <p>This flag is incompatible with {@link #IOSQE_IO_DRAIN}. Using both of them in a single ring is undefined behavior, even when they are not used together in
     * a single request. Currently, after the first request with {@code IOSQE_CQE_SKIP_SUCCESS}, all subsequent requests marked with drain will be failed
     * at submission time. Note that the error reporting is best effort only, and restrictions may change in the future.</p>

     * This flag should be set in conjunction with struct {@code io_uring_params.wq_fd} being set to an existing {@code io_uring} ring file descriptor.
     * 
     * <p>When set, the {@code io_uring} instance being created will share the asynchronous worker thread backend of the specified {@code io_uring} ring,
     * rather than create a new separate thread pool.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_R_DISABLED SETUP_R_DISABLED} - 
     * If this flag is specified, the io_uring ring starts in a disabled state.
     * 
     * <p>In this state, restrictions can be registered, but submissions are not allowed. See {@link #io_uring_register register} for details on how to enable the ring.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.10.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_SUBMIT_ALL SETUP_SUBMIT_ALL} - 
     * Continue submit on error.
     * 
     * <p>Normally io_uring stops submitting a batch of request, if one of these requests results in an error. This can cause submission of less than what is
     * expected, if a request ends in error while being submitted. If the ring is created with this flag, {@link #io_uring_enter enter} will continue submitting requests even
     * if it encounters an error submitting a request. CQEs are still posted for errored request regardless of whether or not this flag is set at ring
     * creation time, the only difference is if the submit sequence is halted or continued when an error is observed.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.18.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN} - 
     * Cooperative task running.
     * 
     * <p>By default, io_uring will interrupt a task running in userspace when a completion event comes in. This is to ensure that completions run in a
     * timely manner. For a lot of use cases, this is overkill and can cause reduced performance from both the inter-processor interrupt used to do this,
     * the kernel/user transition, the needless interruption of the tasks userspace activities, and reduced batching if completions come in at a rapid
     * rate. Most applications don't need the forceful interruption, as the events are processed at any kernel/user transition. The exception are setups
     * where the application uses multiple threads operating on the same ring, where the application waiting on completions isn't the one that submitted
     * them. For most other use cases, setting this flag will improve performance.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.19.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_TASKRUN_FLAG SETUP_TASKRUN_FLAG} - 
     * Used in conjunction with {@link #IORING_SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN SETUP_COOP_TASKRUN}, this provides a flag, {@link #IORING_SQ_TASKRUN SQ_TASKRUN}, which is set in the SQ ring {@code flags} whenever completions are
     * pending that should be processed. liburing will check for this flag even when doing {@link LibURing#io_uring_peek_cqe peek_cqe} and enter the kernel to process them, and
     * applications can do the same. This makes {@code IORING_SETUP_TASKRUN_FLAG} safe to use even when applications rely on a peek style operation on the
     * CQ ring to see if anything might be pending to reap.
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.19.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_SQE128 SETUP_SQE128} - 
     * If set, io_uring will use 128-byte SQEs rather than the normal 64-byte sized variant.
     * 
     * <p>This is a requirement for using certain request types, as of 5.19 only the {@link #IORING_OP_URING_CMD OP_URING_CMD} passthrough command for NVMe passthrough needs this.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.19.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_CQE32 SETUP_CQE32} - 
     * If set, io_uring will use 32-byte CQEs rather than the normal 32-byte sized variant.
     * 
     * <p>This is a requirement for using certain request types, as of 5.19 only the {@link #IORING_OP_URING_CMD OP_URING_CMD} passthrough command for NVMe passthrough needs this.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.19.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER} - 
     * A hint to the kernel that only a single task can submit requests, which is used for internal optimisations.
     * 
     * <p>The kernel enforces the rule, which only affects {@link #io_uring_enter enter} calls submitting requests and will fail them with {@code -EEXIST} if the restriction is
     * violated. The submitter task may differ from the task that created the ring. Note that when {@link #IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL SETUP_SQPOLL} is set it is considered that the polling
     * task is doing all submissions on behalf of the userspace and so it always complies with the rule disregarding how many userspace tasks do
     * {@code io_uring_enter}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.20.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN SETUP_DEFER_TASKRUN} - 
     * Defer running task work to get events.
     * 
     * <p>By default, io_uring will process all outstanding work at the end of any system call or thread interrupt. This can delay the application from
     * making other progress. Setting this flag will hint to io_uring that it should defer work until an {@link #io_uring_enter enter} call with the {@link #IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS ENTER_GETEVENTS} flag set.
     * This allows the application to request work to run just before it wants to process completions. This flag requires the {@link #IORING_SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER SETUP_SINGLE_ISSUER} flag to
     * be set, and also enforces that the call to {@code io_uring_enter} is called from the same thread that submitted requests. Note that if this flag is
     * set then it is the application's responsibility to periodically trigger work (for example via any of the CQE waiting functions) or else completions
     * may not be delivered.</p>

     * {@code io_uring_op}
     * 
     * <h5>Enum values:</h5>
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_NOP OP_NOP} - Do not perform any I/O. This is useful for testing the performance of the {@code io_uring} implementation itself.</li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_READV OP_READV} - Vectored read operation, similar to {@code preadv2(2)}. If the file is not seekable, {@code off} must be set to zero.</li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_WRITEV OP_WRITEV} - Vectored write operation, similar to {@code pwritev2(2)}. If the file is not seekable, {@code off} must be set to zero.</li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_FSYNC OP_FSYNC} - 
     * File sync. See also {@code fsync(2)}.
     * 
     * <p>Note that, while I/O is initiated in the order in which it appears inthe submission queue, completions are unordered. For example, an application
     * which places a write I/O followed by an fsync in the submission queue cannot expect the fsync to apply to the write. The two operations execute in
     * parallel, so the fsync may complete before the write is issued to the storage. The same is also true for previously issued writes that have not
     * completed prior to the fsync.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_READ_FIXED OP_READ_FIXED} - Read from pre-mapped buffers. See {@link #io_uring_register register} for details on how to setup a context for fixed reads.</li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED OP_WRITE_FIXED} - Write to pre-mapped buffers. See {@link #io_uring_register register} for details on how to setup a context for fixed writes.</li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_POLL_ADD OP_POLL_ADD} - 
     * Poll the {@code fd} specified in the submission queue entry for the events specified in the {@code poll_events} field.
     * 
     * <p>Unlike poll or epoll without {@code EPOLLONESHOT}, by default this interface always works in one shot mode. That is, once the poll operation is
     * completed, it will have to be resubmitted.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If {@link #IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI POLL_ADD_MULTI} is set in the SQE {@code len} field, then the poll will work in multi shot mode instead. That means it'll repatedly trigger when
     * the requested event becomes true, and hence multiple CQEs can be generated from this single SQE. The CQE {@code flags} field will have {@link #IORING_CQE_F_MORE CQE_F_MORE}
     * set on completion if the application should expect further CQE entries from the original request. If this flag isn't set on completion, then the
     * poll request has been terminated and no further events will be generated. This mode is available since 5.13.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If {@link #IORING_POLL_UPDATE_EVENTS POLL_UPDATE_EVENTS} is set in the SQE {@code len} field, then the request will update an existing poll request with the mask of events passed in
     * with this request. The lookup is based on the {@code user_data} field of the original SQE submitted, and this values is passed in the {@code addr}
     * field of the SQE. This mode is available since 5.13.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If {@link #IORING_POLL_UPDATE_USER_DATA POLL_UPDATE_USER_DATA} is set in the SQE {@code len} field, then the request will update the {@code user_data} of an existing poll request based
     * on the value passed in the {@code off} field. This mode is available since 5.13.</p>
     * 
     * <p>This command works like an {@code asyncpoll(2)} and the completion event result is the returned mask of events. For the variants that update
     * {@code user_data} or {@code events}, the completion result will be similar to {@link #IORING_OP_POLL_REMOVE OP_POLL_REMOVE}.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_POLL_REMOVE OP_POLL_REMOVE} - 
     * Remove an existing poll request.
     * 
     * <p>If found, the {@code res} field of the struct {@code io_uring_cqe} will contain 0. If not found, {@code res} will contain {@code -ENOENT}, or
     * {@code -EALREADY} if the poll request was in the process of completing already.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_SYNC_FILE_RANGE OP_SYNC_FILE_RANGE} - 
     * Issue the equivalent of a {@code sync_file_range(2)} on the file descriptor.
     * 
     * <p>The {@code fd} field is the file descriptor to sync, the {@code off} field holds the offset in bytes, the {@code len} field holds the length in
     * bytes, and the {@code sync_range_flags} field holds the flags for the command. See also {@code sync_file_range(2)} for the general description of
     * the related system call.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.2.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_SENDMSG OP_SENDMSG} - 
     * Issue the equivalent of a {@code sendmsg(2)} system call.
     * 
     * <p>{@code fd} must be set to the socket file descriptor, {@code addr} must contain a pointer to the {@code msghdr} structure, and {@code msg_flags}
     * holds the flags associated with the system call. See also {@code sendmsg(2)} for the general description of the related system call.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.3.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_RECVMSG OP_RECVMSG} - 
     * Works just like {@link #IORING_OP_SENDMSG OP_SENDMSG}, except for {@code recvmsg(2)} instead. See the description of {@code IORING_OP_SENDMSG}.
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.3.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_TIMEOUT OP_TIMEOUT} - 
     * This command will register a timeout operation.
     * 
     * <p>The {@code addr} field must contain a pointer to a {@code struct timespec64} structure, {@code len} must contain 1 to signify one
     * {@code timespec64} structure, {@code timeout_flags} may contain {@link #IORING_TIMEOUT_ABS TIMEOUT_ABS} for an absolute timeout value, or 0 for a relative timeout.
     * {@code off} may contain a completion event count. A timeout will trigger a wakeup event on the completion ring for anyone waiting for events. A
     * timeout condition is met when either the specified timeout expires, or the specified number of events have completed. Either condition will trigger
     * the event. If set to 0, completed events are not counted, which effectively acts like a timer. {@code io_uring} timeouts use the
     * {@code CLOCK_MONOTONIC} clock source. The request will complete with {@code -ETIME} if the timeout got completed through expiration of the timer,
     * or 0 if the timeout got completed through requests completing on their own. If the timeout was cancelled before it expired, the request will
     * complete with {@code -ECANCELED}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.4.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Since 5.15, this command also supports the following modifiers in {@code timeout_flags}:</p>
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_TIMEOUT_BOOTTIME TIMEOUT_BOOTTIME}: If set, then the clock source used is {@code CLOCK_BOOTTIME} instead of {@code CLOCK_MONOTONIC}. This clock source differs
     * in that it includes time elapsed if the system was suspend while having a timeout request in-flight.</li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_TIMEOUT_REALTIME TIMEOUT_REALTIME}: If set, then the clock source used is {@code CLOCK_BOOTTIME} instead of {@code CLOCK_MONOTONIC}.</li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_TIMEOUT_REMOVE OP_TIMEOUT_REMOVE} - 
     * If {@code timeout_flags} are zero, then it attempts to remove an existing timeout operation. {@code addr} must contain the {@code user_data} field
     * of the previously issued timeout operation. If the specified timeout request is found and cancelled successfully, this request will terminate with
     * a result value of 0. If the timeout request was found but expiration was already in progress, this request will terminate with a result value of
     * {@code -EBUSY}. If the timeout request wasn't found, the request will terminate with a result value of {@code -ENOENT}.
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.5.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If {@code timeout_flags} contain {@link #IORING_TIMEOUT_UPDATE TIMEOUT_UPDATE}, instead of removing an existing operation, it updates it. {@code addr} and return values are same
     * as before. {@code addr2} field must contain a pointer to a {@code struct timespec64} structure. {@code timeout_flags} may also contain
     * {@link #IORING_TIMEOUT_ABS TIMEOUT_ABS}, in which case the value given is an absolute one, not a relative one.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.11.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_ACCEPT OP_ACCEPT} - 
     * Issue the equivalent of an {@code accept4(2)} system call.
     * 
     * <p>{@code fd} must be set to the socket file descriptor, {@code addr} must contain the pointer to the {@code sockaddr} structure, and {@code addr2}
     * must contain a pointer to the {@code socklen_t} {@code addrlen} field. Flags can be passed using the {@code accept_flags} field. See also
     * {@code accept4(2)} for the general description of the related system call.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.5.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If the {@code file_index} field is set to a positive number, the file won't be installed into the normal file table as usual but will be placed
     * into the fixed file table at index {@code file_index - 1}. In this case, instead of returning a file descriptor, the result will contain either 0
     * on success or an error. If the index points to a valid empty slot, the installation is guaranteed to not fail. If there is already a file in the
     * slot, it will be replaced, similar to {@link #IORING_OP_FILES_UPDATE OP_FILES_UPDATE}. Please note that only {@code io_uring} has access to such files and no other syscall can
     * use them. See {@link #IOSQE_FIXED_FILE} and {@link #IORING_REGISTER_FILES REGISTER_FILES}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.5.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_ASYNC_CANCEL OP_ASYNC_CANCEL} - 
     * Attempt to cancel an already issued request.
     * 
     * <p>{@code addr} must contain the {@code user_data} field of the request that should be cancelled. The cancellation request will complete with one of
     * the following results codes. If found, the {@code res} field of the cqe will contain 0. If not found, {@code res} will contain {@code -ENOENT}. If
     * found and attempted cancelled, the {@code res} field will contain {@code -EALREADY}. In this case, the request may or may not terminate. In
     * general, requests that are interruptible (like socket IO) will get cancelled, while disk IO requests cannot be cancelled if already started.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.5.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT OP_LINK_TIMEOUT} - 
     * This request must be linked with another request through {@link #IOSQE_IO_LINK} which is described below.
     * 
     * <p>Unlike {@link #IORING_OP_TIMEOUT OP_TIMEOUT}, {@code IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT} acts on the linked request, not the completion queue. The format of the command is otherwise
     * like {@code IORING_OP_TIMEOUT}, except there's no completion event count as it's tied to a specific request. If used, the timeout specified in the
     * command will cancel the linked command, unless the linked command completes before the timeout. The timeout will complete with {@code -ETIME} if
     * the timer expired and the linked request was attempted cancelled, or {@code -ECANCELED} if the timer got cancelled because of completion of the
     * linked request. Like {@code IORING_OP_TIMEOUT} the clock source used is {@code CLOCK_MONOTONIC}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.5.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_CONNECT OP_CONNECT} -

     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_FALLOCATE OP_FALLOCATE} - 
     * Issue the equivalent of a {@code fallocate(2)} system call.
     * 
     * <p>{@code fd} must be set to the file descriptor, {@code len} must contain the mode associated with the operation, {@code off} must contain the offset

     * <p>Available since 5.6.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_OPENAT OP_OPENAT} - 
     * Issue the equivalent of a {@code openat(2)} system call.
     * 
     * <p>{@code fd} is the {@code dirfd} argument, {@code addr} must contain a pointer to the {@code *pathname} argument, {@code open_flags} should contain
     * any flags passed in, and {@code len} is access mode of the file. See also {@code openat(2)} for the general description of the related system call.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.6.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If the {@code file_index} field is set to a positive number, the file won't be installed into the normal file table as usual but will be placed
     * into the fixed file table at index {@code file_index - 1}. In this case, instead of returning a file descriptor, the result will contain either 0
     * on success or an error. If there is already a file registered at this index, the request will fail with {@code -EBADF}. Only {@code io_uring} has
     * access to such files and no other syscall can use them. See {@link #IOSQE_FIXED_FILE} and {@link #IORING_REGISTER_FILES REGISTER_FILES}.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.15.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_CLOSE OP_CLOSE} - 
     * Issue the equivalent of a {@code close(2)} system call.
     * 
     * <p>{@code fd} is the file descriptor to be closed. See also {@code close(2)} for the general description of the related system call.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Available since 5.6.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If the {@code file_index} field is set to a positive number, this command can be used to close files that were direct opened through {@link #IORING_OP_OPENAT OP_OPENAT},
     * {@link #IORING_OP_OPENAT2 OP_OPENAT2}, or {@link #IORING_OP_ACCEPT OP_ACCEPT} using the {@code io_uring} specific direct descriptors. Note that only one of the descriptor fields may be set. The
     * direct close feature is available since the 5.15 kernel, where direct descriptors were introduced.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_OP_FILES_UPDATE OP_FILES_UPDATE} - 
     * This command is an alternative to using {@link #IORING_REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE REGISTER_FILES_UPDATE} which then works in an async fashion, like the rest of the {@code io_uring}
     * commands.
     * 
     * <p>The arguments passed in are the same. {@code addr} must contain a pointer to the array of file descriptors, {@code len} must contain the length of

     * the group ID, and each buffer within this group will be identical in size according to the above arguments. This allows the application to provide
     * different groups of buffers, and this is often used to have differently sized buffers available depending on what the expectations are of the
     * individual request. When submitting a request that should use a provided buffer, the {@link #IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT} flag must be set, and {@code buf_group}

     * 
     * <p>This means that requests that cannot read or write data to a file no longer need to be punted to an async thread for handling, instead they will
     * begin operation when the file is ready. This is similar to doing poll + read/write in userspace, but eliminates the need to do so. If this flag is
     * set, requests waiting on space/data consume a lot less resources doing so as they are not blocking a thread.</p>

     * 
     * <p>Available since kernel 5.13.</p>
     * </li>
     * <li>{@link #IORING_FEAT_CQE_SKIP FEAT_CQE_SKIP} - 
     * If this flag is set, then io_uring supports setting {@link #IOSQE_CQE_SKIP_SUCCESS} in the submitted SQE, indicating that no CQE should be generated for

     * <li>{@link #IORING_FEAT_LINKED_FILE FEAT_LINKED_FILE} - 
     * If this flag is set, then io_uring supports sane assignment of files for SQEs that have dependencies. For example, if a chain of SQEs are submitted
     * with {@link #IOSQE_IO_LINK}, then kernels without this flag will prepare the file for each link upfront. If a previous link opens a file with a known
