     * Provides the application with a way to indicate which device a set of memory objects should be associated. Typically, memory objects are implicitly
     * migrated to a device for which enqueued commands, using the memory object, are targeted. clEnqueueMigrateMemObjectEXT allows this migration to be
     * explicitly performed ahead of the dependent commands. This permits an application to overlap the placement of memory objects with other unrelated
     * operations. Once the OpenCL event, returned from clEnqueueMigrateMemObject, has been marked {@link CL10#CL_COMPLETE COMPLETE} the memory objects specified in
     * {@code mem_objects} have been successfully migrated to the device associated with {@code command_queue}. The migrated memory object shall remain
     * resident on the device until another command is enqueued that either implicitly or explicitly migrates it away. As well, clEnqueueMigrateMemObjectEXT
     * can be used to direct the initial placement of a memory object, after creation, possibly avoiding the initial overhead of instantiating the object on
     * the first enqueued command to use it.
     * 
     * <p>The user is responsible for managing the event dependencies, associated with this command, in order to avoid overlapping access to memory objects.
     * Improperly specified event dependencies passed to clEnqueueMigrateMemObject could result in undefined results.</p>

     * @param event_wait_list a list of events that need to complete before this particular command can be executed. If {@code event_wait_list} is {@code NULL}, then this particular command
     *                        does not wait on any event to complete. The events specified in {@code event_wait_list} act as synchronization points. The context associated with events in
     *                        {@code event_wait_list} and {@code command_queue} must be the same.
     * @param event           Returns an event object that identifies this particular command and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular command to complete.
     *                        {@code event} can be {@code NULL} in which case it will not be possible for the application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to
     *                        complete. If the {@code event_wait_list} and the {@code event} arguments are not {@code NULL}, the event argument should not refer to an element of the
