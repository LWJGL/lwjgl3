        Provides the application with a way to indicate which device a set of memory objects should be associated. Typically, memory objects are implicitly
        migrated to a device for which enqueued commands, using the memory object, are targeted. clEnqueueMigrateMemObjectEXT allows this migration to be
        explicitly performed ahead of the dependent commands. This permits an application to overlap the placement of memory objects with other unrelated
        operations. Once the OpenCL event, returned from clEnqueueMigrateMemObject, has been marked #COMPLETE the memory objects specified in
        {@code mem_objects} have been successfully migrated to the device associated with {@code command_queue}. The migrated memory object shall remain
        resident on the device until another command is enqueued that either implicitly or explicitly migrates it away. As well, clEnqueueMigrateMemObjectEXT
        can be used to direct the initial placement of a memory object, after creation, possibly avoiding the initial overhead of instantiating the object on
        the first enqueued command to use it.

        The user is responsible for managing the event dependencies, associated with this command, in order to avoid overlapping access to memory objects.
        Improperly specified event dependencies passed to clEnqueueMigrateMemObject could result in undefined results.
