        Native bindings to the $extensionLink extension.

        The accelerator extension consists of a unified set of OpenCL runtime APIs to create, query, and manage the lifetime of objects which represent
        acceleration processors, engines, or algorithms. Accelerator object instances are referenced with the generic cl_accelerator_intel type by the runtime
        API, but they are always associated with a specific acceleration engine type, which is assigned by the application at accelerator object creation time.
        Descriptors are used to assign acceleration engine-specific properties to the accelerator objects. This mechanism of specialized creation with generic
        referencing is analogous to the way image objects are managed in the OpenCL 1.2 runtime API via generic cl_mem referencing but specialized
        descriptor-based creation with #CreateImage().

        Each accelerator object is assigned a unique type id. Vendors are freely encouraged to define new accelerator types and ids. This base extension
        provides unified mechanism for the creation and lifetime management of new accelerator types, but the semantics and creation descriptors of these types
        are to be defined in acceleration engine-specific extensions.

        Accelerator objects can be supplied to kernels as arguments. Unless an extension defines a new OpenCL C language type for the engine-specific
        accelerator (e.g. sampler_t), accelerator objects can only be used in conjunction with built-in kernels. If an extension does define such a new type,
        or if it provides a mechanism to access accelerator data within kernels, then accelerator objects can act as regular kernel arguments as well.

        Requires ${CL12.link}.
