        The OpenCL 1.0 OpenGL interoperability functionality.

        OpenCL memory objects may be created from OpenGL objects if and only if the OpenCL context has been created from an OpenGL share group object or
        context. OpenGL share groups and contexts are created using platform specific APIs such as EGL, CGL, WGL, and GLX. On macOS, an OpenCL context
        may be created from an OpenGL share group object using the OpenCL platform extension <strong>cl_apple_gl_sharing</strong>. On other platforms
        including Microsoft Windows, Linux/Unix and others, an OpenCL context may be created from an OpenGL context using the Khronos platform extension
        <strong>cl_khr_gl_sharing</strong>.

        Any supported OpenGL object defined within the GL share group object, or the share group associated with the GL context from which the CL context
        is created, may be shared, with the exception of the default OpenGL objects (i.e. objects named zero), which may not be shared.

        <h3>Lifetime of Shared Objects</h3>

        An OpenCL memory object created from an OpenGL object (hereinafter refered to as a “shared CL/GL object”) remains valid as long as the
        corresponding GL object has not been deleted. If the GL object is deleted through the GL API (e.g. {@code glDeleteBuffers}, {@code glDeleteTextures},
        or {@code glDeleteRenderbuffers}), subsequent use of the CL buffer or image object will result in undefined behavior, including but not limited to
        possible CL errors and data corruption, but may not result in program termination.

        The CL context and corresponding command-queues are dependent on the existence of the GL share group object, or the share group associated with the
        GL context from which the CL context is created. If the GL share group object or all GL contexts in the share group are destroyed, any use of the
        CL context or command-queue(s) will result in undefined behavior, which may include program termination. Applications should destroy the CL
        command-queue(s) and CL context before destroying the corresponding GL share group or contexts.

        <h3>Synchronizing OpenCL and OpenGL Access to Shared Objects</h3>

        The application is responsible for maintaining the proper order of operations if the CL and GL contexts are in separate threads.

        If a GL context is bound to a thread other than the one in which #EnqueueReleaseGLObjects() is called, changes to any of the objects in
        {@code mem_objects} may not be visible to that context without additional steps being taken by the application. For an OpenGL 3.1 (or later)
        context, the requirements are described in Appendix D ("Shared Objects and Multiple Contexts") of the OpenGL 3.1 Specification. For prior versions
        of OpenGL, the requirements are implementation dependent.

        Attempting to access the data store of an OpenGL object after it has been acquired by OpenCL and before it has been released will result in
        undefined behavior. Similarly, attempting to access a shared CL/GL object from OpenCL before it has been acquired by the OpenCL command queue, or
        after it has been released, will result in undefined behavior.

        OpenGL objects are released by the OpenCL context associated with {@code command_queue}.

        After calling {@code clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects}, the application is responsible for ensuring that any pending OpenCL operations which access the objects
        specified in {@code mem_objects} have completed prior to executing subsequent GL commands which reference these objects. This may be accomplished
        portably by calling #WaitForEvents() with the event object returned by {@code clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects}, or by calling #Finish().
        Some implementations may offer more efficient methods.
