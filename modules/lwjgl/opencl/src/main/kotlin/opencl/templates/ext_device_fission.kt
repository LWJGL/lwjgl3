        Native bindings to the $extensionLink extension.

        This extension provides an interface for sub-dividing an OpenCL device into multiple sub-devices. There are a number of cases in which a typical user
        would like to subdivide a device:
        ${ol(
            "To reserve part of the device for use for high priority / latency-sensitive tasks",
            "To more directly control the assignment of work to individual compute units",
            "To subdivide compute devices along some shared hardware feature like a cache"
        )}
        Typically these are areas where some level of additional control is required to get optimal performance beyond that provided by standard OpenCL 1.1
        APIs. Proper use of this interface assumes some detailed knowledge of the devices in question.
