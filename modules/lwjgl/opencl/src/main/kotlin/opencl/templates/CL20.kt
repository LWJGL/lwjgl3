        Allocates a shared virtual memory buffer (referred to as a SVM buffer) that can be shared by the host and all devices in an OpenCL context that support
        shared virtual memory.

        If #MEM_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_BUFFER is not specified, the buffer can be created as a coarse grained SVM allocation. Similarly, if
        #MEM_SVM_ATOMICS is not specified, the buffer can be created without support for the OpenCL 2.0 SVM atomic operations.

        Calling {@code SVMAlloc} does not itself provide consistency for the shared memory region. When the host can't use the SVM atomic operations, it must
        rely on OpenCL's guaranteed memory consistency at synchronization points. To initialize a buffer to be shared with a kernel, the host can create the
        buffer and use the resulting virtual memory pointer to initialize the buffer's contents.

        For SVM to be used efficiently, the host and any devices sharing a buffer containing virtual memory pointers should have the same endianness. If the
        context passed to {@code SVMAlloc} has devices with mixed endianness and the OpenCL implementation is unable to implement SVM because of that mixed
        endianness, {@code SVMAlloc} will fail and return #NULL.

        Although SVM is generally not supported for image objects, #CreateImage() may create an image from a buffer (a 1D image from a buffer
        or a 2D image from buffer) if the buffer specified in its image description parameter is a SVM buffer. Such images have a linear memory representation
        so their memory can be shared using SVM. However, fine grained sharing and atomics are not supported for image reads and writes in a kernel.

        If #CreateBuffer() is called with a pointer returned by {@code SVMAlloc} as its {@code host_ptr} argument, and
        #MEM_USE_HOST_PTR is set in its {@code flags} argument, {@code CreateBuffer} will succeed and return a valid non-zero buffer object as
        long as the {@code size} argument to {@code CreateBuffer} is no larger than the {@code size} argument passed in the original {@code SVMAlloc} call. The
        new buffer object returned has the shared memory as the underlying storage. Locations in the buffer's underlying shared memory can be operated on using,

        NOTES

        1. Coarse-grain or fine-grain buffer SVM pointers used by a kernel which are not passed as a kernel arguments must be specified using
        {@code SetKernelExecInfo} with #KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS. For example, if SVM buffer A contains a pointer to another SVM buffer B, and the
        kernel dereferences that pointer, then a pointer to B must either be passed as an argument in the call to that kernel or it must be made available to
        the kernel using {@code SetKernelExecInfo}. For example, we might pass extra SVM pointers as follows:

        {@code clSetKernelExecInfo(kernel, CL_KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS, num_ptrs * sizeof(void *), extra_svm_ptr_list);}

        Here {@code num_ptrs} specifies the number of additional SVM pointers while {@code extra_svm_ptr_list} specifies a pointer to memory containing those
        SVM pointers. When calling {@code SetKernelExecInfo} with #KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_PTRS to specify pointers to non-argument SVM buffers as extra
        arguments to a kernel, each of these pointers can be the SVM pointer returned by #SVMAlloc() or can be a pointer + offset into the SVM region. It is
        sufficient to provide one pointer for each SVM buffer used.

        2. #KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM is used to indicate whether SVM pointers used by a kernel will refer to system allocations or not.

        #KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM = $FALSE indicates that the OpenCL implementation may assume that system pointers are not passed as
        kernel arguments and are not stored inside SVM allocations passed as kernel arguments.

        #KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM = $TRUE indicates that the OpenCL implementation must assume that system pointers might be passed as
        kernel arguments and/or stored inside SVM allocations passed as kernel arguments. In this case, if the device to which the kernel is enqueued does not
        support system SVM pointers, #EnqueueNDRangeKernel() will return a $INVALID_OPERATION error. If none of the devices in the context
        associated with kernel support fine-grain system SVM allocations, {@code SetKernelExecInfo} will return a $INVALID_OPERATION error.

        If {@code SetKernelExecInfo} has not been called with a value for #KERNEL_EXEC_INFO_SVM_FINE_GRAIN_SYSTEM, the default value is used for this
        kernel attribute. The default value depends on whether the device on which the kernel is enqueued supports fine-grain system SVM allocations. If so, the
        default value used is $TRUE (system pointers might be passed); otherwise, the default is $FALSE.
