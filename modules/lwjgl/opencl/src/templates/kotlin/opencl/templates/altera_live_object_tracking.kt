        Native bindings to the $extensionName extension.

        This extension specifies an API for debugging OpenCL API object leaks in user applications. It provides a mechanism for tracking all live API objects,
        and for enumerating them on demand.

        The OpenCL runtime API generates and uses many kinds of objects such as contexts, programs, kernels, memory objects, command queues, and events.

        It is very easy for an application to lose track of what objects it has created but not yet fully released. Forgetting to fully release an object after
        use may result in undesirable behaviour, such as increased memory use or even command scheduler lockup. This problem gets much worse when new objects
        leak each time through an application loop.

        This extension defines two runtime API methods.

        The first method specifies a future interest in enumerating all the live objects in the runtime API. Live object tracking is a debugging feature which
        may increase memory use and runtime of the application. So it should be explicitly requested.

        Ideally, the request to begin tracking live objects should occur as early as possible in the program, so that no leaked objects escape undetected.

        The second method requests an enumeration of those objects via a callback mechanism.
