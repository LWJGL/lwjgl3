        Native bindings to the $extensionLink extension.

        This extension defines an API that allows improved control of the physical memory used by the graphics device.

        It allows to share a memory allocated by the Graphics driver to be used by other device on the bus by exposing a write-only bus address. One example of
        application would be a video capture device which would DMA into the GPU memory.

        It also offers the reverse operation of specifying a buffer allocated on another device to be used for write access by the GPU.
