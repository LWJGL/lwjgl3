        Native bindings to the $extensionLink extension.

        The goal of this extension is to provide interoperability between OpenCL and the cross-platform Video Acceleration API (VA API). The extension
        specifically enables sharing of VA API surfaces for media. It uses similar mechanisms and provides similar surface sharing capabilities for VA API that
        are provided by the Khronos OpenCL 1.2 Media Surface Sharing extension for DX9.

        Requires ${CL12.link} and a VA API implementation supporting sharing of surfaces with OpenCL.
