        Native bindings to the $extensionLink extension.

        This extension enables the device side printf built in function for OpenCL C versions prior to 1.2. It also extends the cl_context_properties
        enumeration to allow a user defined printf callback and/or printf buffer size.

        The printf built in function should be used for debugging purposes only and may have a significant negative impact on the performance of an OpenCL
        application.

        buffer will be shared between kernels executing on a device. The implementation is free to round up or ignore this value.
