        <h3>Using GLFW on macOS</h3> 

        On macOS the JVM must be started with the {@code -XstartOnFirstThread} argument for GLFW to work. This is necessary because most GLFW functions must be
        called on the main thread and the Cocoa API requires that thread to be the first thread in the process. GLFW windows and the GLFW event loop are
        incompatible with other window toolkits (such as AWT/Swing or JavaFX).

        Applications that cannot function with the above limitation may set {@link org.lwjgl.system.Configuration\#GLFW_LIBRARY_NAME GLFW_LIBRARY_NAME} to the
        value {@code "glfw_async"}. This will instruct LWJGL to load an alternative GLFW build that dispatches Cocoa calls to the main thread in blocking mode.
        The other window toolkit must be initialized (e.g. with AWT's {@code Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()}) before #Init() is called.

        Contains bindings to the ${url("https://www.opengl.org/", "OpenGL")} cross-platform 2D and 3D rendering API.

        The ${url("https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_gl.php", "OpenGL registry")} is a useful online resource that contains the OpenGL and OpenGL
        Shading Language specifications, as well as specifications of OpenGL extensions.
        The ${url("https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/", "OpenGL Reference Pages")} is another convenient source of documentation.

        The bindings of the core OpenGL functionality are contained in two distinct class hierarchies:
        ${ul(
            "{@code GL11..GL46}: all symbols of the Compatibility Profile are included",
            "{@code GL11C..GL46C}: only symbols of the Core Profile are included"
        )}

        Each of the above classes extends the class of the previous OpenGL version in the corresponding hierarchy.

        The recommended way to write OpenGL applications with LWJGL is to statically import the class that corresponds to the minimum required OpenGL version.
        This will expose all symbols up to that version. Additional functionality (later core versions or extensions) should be guarded with appropriate checks
        using the {@link org.lwjgl.opengl.GLCapabilities GLCapabilities} instance of the OpenGL context.

        The Compatibility Profile and Core Profile class hierarchies should not be mixed with static imports, as that would result in compilation ambiguities
        when resolving the symbols. Note that the Compatibility Profile hierarchy can be used with a Core Profile context (as long as no deprecated symbol is
        used) and the Core Profile hierarchy can be used with a Compatibility Profile context. The recommendation is to use the Compatibility Profile hierarchy
        only when deprecated functionality is required. In any other case, the Core Profile hierarchy should be preferred.

        For example, an OpenGL application that requires OpenGL 3.3, must use modern OpenGL features only and needs the best possible performance:
        ${ul(
            "Should create a 3.3 Compatibility Profile context. A Core Profile context would have extra validation overhead.",
            "Should use the Core Profile hierarchy to avoid deprecated symbols. Auto-complete lists in an IDE will also be cleaner."
        )}
