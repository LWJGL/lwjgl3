/** This class supports bindings with thread-local contexts. [INTERNAL USE ONLY] */
public final class ThreadLocalUtil {

	/*
	The following applies to GL and GLES only:

	OpenGL contexts may have different capabilities (core versions, supported extensions, deprecated functionality) and different function pointers (usually
	in multi-GPU setups). A ThreadLocal is used to store the current capabilities instance for each thread. The thread-local lookup that is required for each
	function call hurts JIT code generation. We employ two strategies to eliminate this overhead:

	1) The first capabilities instance encountered is stored in a static write-once holder. This is optimistically assumed to be compatible with all other (if
	any) instances we encounter, which is indeed the case for the vast majority of programs. If an incompatible instance is encountered, there is a fall back
	to the thread-local lookup.

	The above is applicable to methods with Critical Natives (i.e. array overloads). All other methods use the following technique:

	2) The function pointers of a capabilities instance is stored in an off-heap array, which is then stored in one of the reserved members of the
	jniNativeInterface struct. This struct is then injected to the Hotspot native thread that corresponds to the Java thread in which the capabilities instance
	was made current. When a JNI method is invoked in that thread, it passes its JNIEnv copy to the JNI function, which can then retrieve the correct function
	pointer.

	It works like so:

	typedef struct JNINativeInterface_ {
		void *reserved0;
        void *reserved1;
        void *reserved2;
        void *reserved3;

        // JNI function pointers
	} jniNativeInterface;

	typedef const jniNativeInterface *JNIEnv;

	// Hotspot C++ class
	class JavaThread: public Thread {
		...
		JNIEnv _jni_environment;
		JNIEnv* jni_environment() { return &_jni_environment; }
		..
	}

	The injection works because what we get in the JNI function is not a direct pointer to the struct, but a pointer to the JavaThread field that contains the
	pointer to the struct.

	Note that all threads point to the same jniNativeInterface struct. Also note that even though reserved0-3 is public API, the size of the struct is not
	known. New Java versions often add new function pointers at the end of the struct. Luckily, JVMTI's GetJNIFunctionTable function can be used to return a
	valid copy.

	- On startup, a pointer to the global jniNativeInterface is stored.
	- On setCapabilities:
		* If necessary, a jniNativeInterface copy is created with JVMTI and injected to the current thread (JavaThread::_jni_environment points to the copy).
		* A pointer to the capabilities function pointer array is set to jniNativeInterface::reserved3.
	- On setCapabilities(null):
		* JavaThread::_jni_environment is reset to the global jniNativeInterface.
		* The jniNativeInterface copy is deallocated with JVMTI.

	The above has the following advantages:

	- Eliminates the thread-local lookup.
	- Less bytecode and perfectly clean JITed code.
	- Works when different threads have incompatible contexts.

	And the following disadvantages:

	- Depends on Hotspot implementation details.
	- Requires custom JNI code for each function.
	- (minor) Function pointers are not checked anymore. Calling an unsupported function causes a segfault.
	- (minor) Critical Natives cannot use it, there's no JNIEnv* parameter.
	- (minor) JVMTI has the ability to intercept JNI functions with SetJNIFunctionTable. This interacts badly with the jniNativeInterface copies, but it should
	be easy to workaround (attaching the agent at startup, making sure no contexts are current when the agent is attached, clearing and setting again the
	capabilities instance).
