## LWJGL - Lightweight Java Game Library 3

LWJGL (https://www.lwjgl.org) is a Java library that enables cross-platform
access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics
(OpenGL/Vulkan), audio (OpenAL) and parallel computing (OpenCL) applications.
This access is direct and high-performance, yet also wrapped in a type-safe
and user-friendly layer, appropriate for the Java ecosystem.

LWJGL is an enabling technology and provides low-level access. It is not a
framework and does not provide higher-level utilities than what the native
libraries expose. As such, novice programmers are encouraged to try one of
the frameworks or game engines that make use of LWJGL, before working
directly with the library.

LWJGL is open source software and freely available at no charge.

For a quick overview of the project structure, installation instructions and
configuration options, see [doc/README](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/tree/master/doc).

For migrating LWJGL 2 code to LWJGL 3, see the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-wiki/wiki/2.6.6-LWJGL3-migration).

As of version `3.1.0`, LWJGL is distributed as a set of modules. Only the
core module is required and all bindings are optional (but some bindings
depend on other bindings). The easiest way to download LWJGL is to use the
[build configurator](https://www.lwjgl.org/download) on the website.

The build configurator generates **Maven & Gradle** declarations that can be
added to existing projects. This is the easiest way to use LWJGL while
developing.

LWJGL can also be downloaded as a simple set of JAR files. Each module
consists of the following files:

* lwjgl-&lt;module&gt;.jar
* lwjgl-&lt;module&gt;-sources.jar
* lwjgl-&lt;module&gt;-javadoc.jar
* lwjgl-&lt;module&gt;-natives-&lt;platform&gt;.jar (for some bindings)

To compile and run an LWJGL application, the base and natives JAR files of
the core module and each binding used should be added to the classpath. LWJGL
extracts the natives to a temporary folder and loads them automatically, so
no further configuration is necessary. If more customization is required
(e.g. when creating a platform-specific installer) the natives may be
extracted manually and loaded via `java.library.path`. See the [Configuration](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/modules/core/src/main/java/org/lwjgl/system/Configuration.java)
class for more options.

LWJGL 3 requires Java 8 or later to build and run and currently supports the
following platforms/architectures:

- Linux x64
- MacOS X x64
- Windows x86
- Windows x64

Example code:

- [Test suite](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/tree/master/modules/core/src/test/java/org/lwjgl/demo) (simple samples covering basic usage of LWJGL bindings)
- [Demo suite](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-demos) (includes advanced OpenGL and Vulkan demos)
- [Wiki tutorials](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-wiki/wiki/2.6.-Tutorial-Index)
